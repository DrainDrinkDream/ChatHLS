Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Identifying the first error**:
   The compiler error log points out an issue with a missing terminating character on line 11 which reads: 
   ```
   'SUM_LOOP:for (i = 2; i < N; i++) {
   ```
   Here, the error messages indicate:
   ```
   "../../../../mem_bottleneck_resolved.cpp:11:2: warning: missing terminating ' character"
   "../../../../mem_bottleneck_resolved.cpp:11:2: error: missing terminating ' character"
   ```
   - **Analysis**: The use of a single quote `'` before `SUM_LOOP` is incorrect. In C++, labels (including HLS loop labels) should not be enclosed or preceded by single quotes. This typo causes the compiler to interpret the rest of the line as a string literal, which is not correctly terminated, leading to a syntax error.

2. **Proposing a fix for the first error**:
   - **Fix**: Remove the single quote before `SUM_LOOP`. The corrected line should be:
     ```cpp
     SUM_LOOP:for (i = 2; i < N; i++) {
     ```

3. **Identifying the second error**:
   Following the fix of the first error, the error log mentioned:
   ```
   "../../../../mem_bottleneck_resolved.cpp:16:3: error: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Werror=return-type]"
   "../../../../mem_bottleneck_resolved.cpp:18:3: error: expected unqualified-id before ‘return’"
   "../../../../mem_bottleneck_resolved.cpp:19:1: error: expected declaration before ‘}’ token"
   ```
   - **Analysis**: These errors suggest that there's confusion about the scope of function blocks due to the syntax error fixed previously. The curly braces `{}` that define the scope of the function or loops might have been misinterpreted due to the initial syntax error with the loop label.

4. **Proposing a fix for the subsequent errors**:
   - **Fix**: After correcting the syntax of the loop label, ensure that the function has a proper return statement within its scope and that all braces `{}` are correctly matched. The corrected portion ensuring this would be:
     ```cpp
     SUM_LOOP:for (i = 2; i < N; i++) {
       tmp2 = mem[i];
       sum += tmp2 + tmp1 + tmp0;
       tmp0 = tmp1;
       tmp1 = tmp2;
     } 
     return sum;
     ```

5. **Reflection and verification**:
   - After making the proposed changes, the function should be syntactically correct. The loop label is fixed, and the function scope defined by `{}` is clear and unambiguous. The corrections align with standard C++ syntax and HLS conventions regarding loop labeling. These changes should resolve the compilation errors, and the function should now perform as intended, summing up the specified elements from the array.

By sequentially addressing the syntax error and then ensuring the structural integrity of the function (in terms of scope and return statements), the issues highlighted in the error log are resolved, leading to a successful compilation and execution of the HLS design.
