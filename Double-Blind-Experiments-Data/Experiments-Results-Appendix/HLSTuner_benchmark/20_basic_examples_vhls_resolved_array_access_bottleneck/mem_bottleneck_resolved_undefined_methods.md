**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Review Compiler Error**: The first step in debugging is to look at the error messages provided by the compiler. In this case, the error log states: `'../../../../mem_bottleneck_resolved.cpp:18:10: error: ‘calculateSum’ was not declared in this scope'`. This indicates that the function `calculateSum` used in the code is not recognized or declared anywhere in the provided scope or includes.

2. **Identify the Error Location**: The error specifically points to the line:
   ```cpp
   return calculateSum(sum);
   ```
   This line attempts to use `calculateSum`, which is not defined or declared.

3. **Hypothesize About the Issue**: Given that `calculateSum` is not recognized, there are a couple of possibilities. Either the function `calculateSum` should be implemented or imported from a library, or it might be an erroneous addition to the code where a simpler operation was intended.

4. **Check Against Expected Functionality**: Analyzing what the function should do, it seems that it is meant to return the value of `sum`. If `calculateSum` was intended to perform additional operations on `sum`, there's no indication or documentation to suggest what those operations might be.

5. **Propose a Fix**: Since there is no other indication that `calculateSum` serves a purpose beyond returning `sum`, and based on the typical operations performed in such a loop (i.e., accumulating a sum), the simplest and most likely correct fix is to directly return `sum`:
   ```cpp
   return sum;
   ```
   Replace the existing line with the above to resolve the compile-time error.

6. **Reflect and Plan Next Steps**: After making this correction, recompile the code to ensure that this resolves the error without introducing new issues. If this fix is correct, the program should compile successfully, and if there's any further logic error, it will need to be addressed based on the program's intended functionality and further error messages, if any.

This step-by-step analysis helps in methodically addressing the error highlighted by the compiler, ensuring that changes are made with an understanding of their implications on the program's functionality.
