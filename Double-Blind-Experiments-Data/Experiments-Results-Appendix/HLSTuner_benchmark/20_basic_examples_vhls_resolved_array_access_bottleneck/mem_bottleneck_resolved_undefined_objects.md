**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the Error:**
   - The compiler error log provided points directly to a line that has an issue. The error specifies:
     ```
     '../../../../mem_bottleneck_resolved.cpp:15:12: error: ‘tmp_2’ was not declared in this scope
     ```
     This indicates that the variable `tmp_2` is not recognized by the compiler.

2. **Analyzing the Reason for the Error:**
   - A closer inspection of the code around the line mentioned in the error log shows:
     ```cpp
     tmp1 = tmp_2;
     ```
     The error message also suggests an alternative, hinting that it might be a typo:
     ```
     note: suggested alternative: ‘tmp2’
     ```
   - Clearly, `tmp_2` is likely a typographical error, as variables in C++ are case-sensitive and must be declared before they are used. The identifier `tmp2` matches the previously declared variable which is being used in the loop for computations.

3. **Proposing a Fix:**
   - To resolve this, the erroneous line:
     ```cpp
     tmp1 = tmp_2;
     ```
     should be corrected to:
     ```cpp
     tmp1 = tmp2;
     ```
     This correction aligns with the use of `tmp2`, which is the intended variable for holding the current memory value in the loop.

4. **Testing and Verification:**
   - After making this correction, the code should be recompiled to ensure that this was the only issue and that no other errors exist. If the compiler passes without further errors, it would validate the hypothesis that this was primarily a typo issue.

5. **Reflection:**
   - Reflecting on this error, it is a straightforward typographical mistake that the compiler could not resolve due to strict rules about variable declarations and scope in C++. It's a common mistake, especially when working with similarly named variables (`tmp2` vs. `tmp_2`). Always double-checking variable names and declarations can prevent such errors. 

By following the detailed reasoning above and correcting the typo in the variable name, the code should now compile and execute correctly, assuming no other issues are present in the rest of the codebase.
