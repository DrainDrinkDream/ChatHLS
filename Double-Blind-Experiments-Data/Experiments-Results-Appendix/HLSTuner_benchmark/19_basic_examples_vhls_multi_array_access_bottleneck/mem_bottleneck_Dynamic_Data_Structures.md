**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Observation:**
   The Vitis HLS compiler error log indicates problems with dynamic memory allocation (usage of `new` and `delete`), as reported by the error messages:
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'array_mem_bottleneck(ap_int<7>*)': Undefined function operator new[] (mem_bottleneck.cpp:8:16)"
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'array_mem_bottleneck(ap_int<7>*)': Undefined function operator delete[] (mem_bottleneck.cpp:13:3)"

2. **Error Analysis:**
   - High-Level Synthesis (HLS) often does not support dynamic memory allocation, as it is hard to predict and synthesize into fixed hardware structures.
   - The usage of `new` and `delete` in the code is meant to instantiate and deallocate an array `mem_1`, which is not utilized elsewhere in the function. This is likely an oversight or residue from a previous version of the code. 

3. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   - Removing the lines involving `new` and `delete` would potentially resolve the errors, as the rest of the function does not depend on `mem_1`.
   - Given that the original code does not include these operations and the function operates directly on the input array `mem`, this hypothesis seems valid.

4. **Testing and Verification:**
   - By comparing the buggy and original code, it is evident that the only difference lies in the presence of dynamic memory operations. The loop that processes the array and computes the sum is identical and does not reference `mem_1`.
   - The errors specifically point to the lines where `new` and `delete` are used, indicating that these operations are not supported or are incorrectly used in this context.

5. **Proposed Fix:**
   - Remove the lines:
     ```cpp
     int* mem_1 = new int[N];
     ```
     and 
     ```cpp
     delete[] mem_1;
     ```
   - This should make the function purely functional without side effects from dynamic memory operations, aligning it with HLS requirements and practices.

6. **Reflection:**
   - HLS tools generally aim to translate high-level code into hardware description languages and configurations. Features such as dynamic memory management that imply unpredictable runtime behavior are often unsupported.
   - The removal of unnecessary dynamic memory allocation should make the code compliant with HLS synthesis requirements while retaining the original functionality of summing specific elements of the input array.

By following these steps, we can confidently adjust the HLS code to be compatible with the synthesis tools, ensuring functional equivalence with the original intent of the code.
