Chain of Thought (CoT):

**Step 1: Analyze Compiler Error Log**
- Looking at the compiler error log, the first issues I noticed are related to the variables `mem_1` and `mem_2`. The compiler suggests that these two identifiers were not declared in the scope:
  ```
  '../../../../mem_bottleneck.cpp:9:21: error: ‘mem_1’ was not declared in this scope'
  '../../../../mem_bottleneck.cpp:9:34: error: ‘mem_2’ was not declared in this scope'
  ```
  The compiler even suggests an alternative, hinting that maybe `mem` should be used instead of `mem_1` and `mem_2`.

**Step 2: Hypothesize the Cause of Errors**
- Given the compiler's suggestion of replacing `mem_1` and `mem_2` with `mem` and considering the nature of the code (an array operation within a loop), it seems plausible that `mem_1[i-1]` and `mem_2[i-2]` were meant to be `mem[i-1]` and `mem[i-2]`. This suggests an error where additional array names (`mem_1`, `mem_2`) were used instead of indexing the original array (`mem`). 

**Step 3: Propose Code Fixes**
- To fix the errors, the erroneous line:
  ```cpp
  sum += mem[i] + mem_1[i-1] + mem_2[i-2];
  ```
  should be replaced with:
  ```cpp
  sum += mem[i] + mem[i-1] + mem[i-2];
  ```
  This change aligns with the typical usage of accessing previous elements in the same array, especially common in moving window operations like summing up consecutive elements.

**Step 4: Testing and Verification**
- After making the proposed changes, the next reasonable step would be to recompile the code. This would verify if the identified bugs were the only issues and if the suggested fixes correctly resolve the compiler errors.

**Step 5: Reflection**
- This debugging session highlighted the importance of ensuring that array accesses are correctly performed, especially in using the right indices and array names. The compiler's suggestions and error messages were instrumental in pinpointing the exact location and nature of the bugs. This process also emphasizes the need for careful review of array operations in C/C++ where a typo or an incorrect index can lead to significant errors or undefined behavior.

In conclusion, the detailed examination of error logs, hypothesizing potential causes, and verifying through iterative testing are key steps in successfully debugging and correcting code in a high-level synthesis context.
