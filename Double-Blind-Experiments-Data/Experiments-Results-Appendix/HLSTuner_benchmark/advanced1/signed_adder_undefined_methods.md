**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Error Identification:**
   - The error log indicates a problem with the line `calculateParity(a, b);`, specifically stating: `'calculateParity' was not declared in this scope`. This means that the function `calculateParity` is either not implemented or not included in the files that are being compiled.

2. **Analysis of the `calculateParity` function call:**
   - The line `calculateParity(a, b);` is attempting to call a function that should presumably calculate the parity of the inputs `a` and `b`. However, since the error log points out its absence in the scope, it suggests that this function is not defined anywhere in the accessible files or headers included in the project.
   - As per the error logs, no other files seem to have compilation issues, so the error is localized to the presence of this undefined function.

3. **Proposing Fixes:**
   - Since the function `calculateParity` is not declared or defined, the immediate fix is to remove or comment out the line `calculateParity(a, b);` from the code. This should resolve the compilation error.

4. **Reflecting on the Findings:**
   - Removing or commenting out the line resolves the immediate compilation issue and aligns the buggy code more closely with the functionality described in the error-free original code.
   - It's also essential to verify whether the function `calculateParity` was intended to be part of the functionality. If it was, then its implementation should be provided, or appropriate headers should be included. If not, removing the call is the correct approach.

5. **Plan Next Steps:**
   - After correcting the error by removing the `calculateParity` function call, the next step would be to recompile the code. This action will verify if there are any more hidden errors or if the removal of this line resolves all issues.
   - If the code then compiles successfully, it would be wise to run the simulation to ensure that the functional logic of the code (calculating the sum and detecting overflow) behaves as expected without the parity calculation.

6. **Final Reflection:**
   - The debugging process highlighted the importance of ensuring that all functions used in the code are correctly declared and defined. It also stresses checking the scope and dependencies in a project to ensure all components compile without errors.
   - Future preventive measures could include more rigorous checking of function dependencies and better management of header files and function declarations. This approach will mitigate similar issues in subsequent projects.
