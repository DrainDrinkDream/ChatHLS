Chain of Thought (CoT):

```text
1. **Identify Errors**:
   - The buggy code contains the line: `static data_t *ram[RAM_SIZE];` where `ram` is defined as a pointer to an array of pointers. This is incorrect for a RAM implementation.

2. **Analyze Reasons**:
   - The error log indicates a runtime error with a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), which usually occurs when there is an attempt to access memory that has not been properly allocated. 
   - The declaration `static data_t *ram[RAM_SIZE];` suggests that each element in the `ram` array is a pointer, but these pointers are not initialized to point to valid memory locations. Thus, dereferencing `ram[addr]` leads to undefined behavior and causes the segmentation fault.

3. **Propose Fixes**:
   - Modify the declaration to `static data_t ram[RAM_SIZE];` to correctly allocate a static array of `data_t` values. This matches the typical RAM behavior where each address directly corresponds to a data location rather than a pointer.

4. **Sequential Reasoning**:
   - First, address the improper memory access issue since it results in a critical runtime error. Ensure that the `ram` is properly defined to store data directly.
   - By changing the pointer array to a simple array, the segmentation fault should be resolved as each address in the `ram` will correspond to a valid data storage location.

5. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - The logical error arises from misunderstanding how RAM should be implemented. RAM in an HLS context should be a direct array of data types, not an array of pointers, which requires separate memory allocations.

6. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Once the modification is made, the hypothesis can be tested by recompiling the code and observing if the segmentation fault is resolved. The expected outcome is that the runtime error will be cleared, facilitating successful simulation.

7. **Reflection**:
   - After addressing the pointer issue, it's crucial to ensure there are no further logical errors by reviewing the overall logic of the program. However, since the primary error was a critical one related to memory access, fixing it should result in successful execution if no other errors are present.
   - Plan to verify the simulation results to ensure that the RAM operations (write and read) function as expected.

By implementing these changes and following this debugging strategy, the runtime error should be resolved, allowing the code to pass simulation successfully.
