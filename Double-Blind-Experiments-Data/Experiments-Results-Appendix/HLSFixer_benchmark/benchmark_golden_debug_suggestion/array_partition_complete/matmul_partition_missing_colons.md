**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Observation and Error Identification:**
   - Start by examining the compiler error log which mentions an issue at line 53 of the `matmul_partition.cpp` file: `error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token`.
   - The specific code snippet triggering this error is `if (col == size - 1) C[row][j] = result`, which lacks a terminating semicolon.

2. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   - The error clearly points out a syntax issue where the statement is missing a semicolon. In C++, every statement must end with a semicolon, indicating the end of the statement to the compiler.

3. **Testing and Verification:**
   - To verify that this syntax error is the sole issue preventing compilation, I will add a semicolon at the end of the line in question.
   - I hypothesize that once the semicolon is added, the syntax error will be resolved, and the code should be ready for further compilation processes. If there are no other syntax errors, the compilation should pass.

4. **Reflection and Planning Next Steps:**
   - After fixing the syntax error, I will recompile the code. If more errors arise, I will re-evaluate the code. If not, I will assume that this was the primary syntax error blocking the initial compilation process.

5. **Proposed Fix:**
   - Add a semicolon at the end of the line `if (col == size - 1) C[row][j] = result` to make it `if (col == size - 1) C[row][j] = result;`.

6. **Final Analysis:**
   - With the syntax error resolved (assuming no further errors are found upon recompilation), the program should be syntactically correct. This correction should allow for successful compilation and further testing phases such as simulation and synthesis if required, though these were not specifically mentioned in the error log provided.

By following this step-by-step debugging process, we address the compiler errors systematically, ensuring that each modification is purposeful and verified against the original error logs. This methodical approach assists in efficiently resolving errors and optimizing the HLS code for successful compilation and execution.
