### Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Identify Errors**:
   The compiler error log indicates a syntax error: `error: expected ‘}’ at end of input`. This points to a missing closing brace `}`. 

2. **Analyze Reasons**:
   By examining the error details, it notes that the missing `}` should match an opening brace that begins at the function definition of `matmul_partition`. The error specifically points to the end of the file suggesting that the function or a block within it is not properly closed.

3. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   Based on the error message pointing to the end of the file (`../../../../matmul_partition.cpp:69:1: error: expected ‘}’ at end of input`), it's clear that a closing brace `}` for a block or for the entire function is missing. Since the error logs do not point to any inner scopes being improperly closed, it is likely that the function itself is missing its closing brace.

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   - I reviewed the code to check for matching braces for all blocks and loops. All internal loops and condition blocks appear to have matching opening and closing braces.
   - Thus, the missing brace is likely for the function itself.

5. **Propose Fixes**:
   - To resolve this, add a closing brace `}` at the end of the function to ensure the function is properly closed. This should be placed after the last loop labeled `writeC`.

6. **Reflection**:
   - The clearly identified missing brace was a straightforward syntactical oversight. Fixing this should allow the program to compile correctly under Vitis HLS.
   - Further compilation or runtime checks might be needed post this fix to ensure there are no deeper logical errors within the loops or array handling, but as per the current compiler error, the missing brace is the primary concern.

### Debugging Conclusion:
Add a closing brace `}` after the `writeC` loop to properly close the `matmul_partition` function in the provided code. This should correct the compilation error shown in the error log.
