**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Analyzing the Compiler Error Log:**
   - The error log contains multiple instances of "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] ... Undefined function operator new[]" and "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] ... Undefined function operator delete[]". This suggests that dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete`) is not supported in the HLS context. We need a memory allocation strategy compatible with HLS constraints.
   - "WARNING: [HLS 207-5560] Array_Partition/Array_Reshape pragma is ignored, because variable is scalar type" indicates issues with how arrays are declared or used with `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION`. This suggests a problem with the array definitions.

2. **Identifying Errors in Buggy Code:**
   - **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**
     - The code uses dynamic memory allocation for arrays `A`, `B`, `C`, and `temp_sum`. HLS does not support dynamic memory allocation, so this needs to be changed to static allocation.
   - **Array Partitioning Pragmas:**
     - The erroneous pragma messages suggest that the arrays are not recognized as arrays suitable for partitioning. This would typically happen if the arrays are not statically defined.

3. **Proposing Fixes:**
   - **Replace Dynamic Memory Allocation:**
     - Replace `int* A = new int[MAX_SIZE * MAX_SIZE];` with `int A[MAX_SIZE][MAX_SIZE];`, and similarly for `B`, `C`, and `temp_sum`. This changes them from dynamically allocated single-dimensional arrays to statically allocated two-dimensional arrays, which are more suitable for HLS synthesis.
   - **Remove Dynamic Memory Deallocation:**
     - Remove the lines `delete[] A;`, `delete[] B;`, `delete[] C;`, `delete[] temp_sum;` since these operations are not required for statically allocated arrays.

4. **Reflection:**
   - The proposed changes should rectify the issues mentioned in the error log. By converting dynamic allocations to static, we address both the synthesis errors related to `new` and `delete` and the warnings regarding array partitioning. After making these changes, the `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION` should correctly apply to the arrays, optimizing the design for parallel execution.

5. **Final Steps:**
   - After making the changes, the modified code should be recompiled and retested in the HLS tool to confirm that all previous errors are resolved and that the functionality remains correct. The expected outcome is that no errors or warnings related to memory allocation or array partitioning appear, and the matrix multiplication logic executes correctly with potential performance benefits from the array partitioning.
