**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Analysis:**
   The error log indicates a syntax error related to the use of the keyword 'let' which is not recognized by the C++ compiler. The error messages specify that 'let' was not declared in the scope during the loop initialization in the `writeC` loop. Additional errors point to the variables `itr`, `i`, and `j` being undeclared, which are all declared in the same problematic line.

2. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   Since 'let' is not a valid keyword in C++, the error likely originated from an incorrect transcription or misunderstanding of C++ syntax, possibly influenced by syntax from other languages like JavaScript, where 'let' is used for declaring variables.

3. **Proposed Solution:**
   Replace the `let` keyword with `int` for proper declaration of the variables in the loop. This should align with the C++ syntax and resolve the compilation errors regarding undeclared variables `itr`, `i`, and `j`.

4. **Implementation and Verification:**
   Change the line in the `writeC` loop from:
   ```cpp
   for (let itr = 0, i = 0, j = 0; itr < size * size; itr++, j++) {
   ```
   to:
   ```cpp
   for (int itr = 0, i = 0, j = 0; itr < size * size; itr++, j++) {
   ```
   After making this change, recompile the code. The expectation is that this syntax error will be resolved, and we should check if there are any more errors or if the logic behaves as intended.

5. **Reflection:**
   The syntax error was a basic one, often caught by a simple syntax check or by an IDE's linting tool before even attempting to compile. Correcting it was straightforward. After fixing it, it is critical to reassess the code to ensure no further syntax or logical errors remain, particularly in scenarios where the compilation errors masked other issues. If the code compiles successfully thereafter, further testing should be conducted to validate the functional correctness of the matrix multiplication implementation. If any other issues arise, they should be addressed sequentially in a similar manner.
