**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Review of Error Log:**
   The error log from the HLS compiler indicates issues with the functions `sqrt` and `pow` not being declared in the scope. These are standard mathematical functions that should be accessible through the `<cmath>` library in C++. The error messages suggest that the compiler could not find declarations for these functions and even suggested alternatives which are incorrect. This is a common error when the appropriate header file for these functions is not included.

2. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   Given the errors, my primary hypothesis is that the necessary header for these functions (`<cmath>`) is not included in the `matmul_partition.cpp` file. This hypothesis aligns with the type of error thrown by the compiler (functions not declared in this scope).

3. **Proposed Solution:**
   To resolve this, the appropriate header file needs to be included at the beginning of the source file. Adding `#include <cmath>` should make the `sqrt` and `pow` functions available to the compiler.

4. **Code Modification:**
   I propose to modify the buggy code by adding `#include <cmath>` at the top of the file:
   ```cpp
   #include <cmath>
   #include "matmul_partition.h"
   ```

5. **Reflection on the Approach:**
   This approach directly addresses the compiler errors related to undefined functions by ensuring the necessary mathematical functions are accessible. Including the correct header is a common requirement and a standard practice in C++ development, especially when using library-defined functions.

6. **Next Steps:**
   After making this change, the next logical step would be to recompile the code to see if the inclusion of `<cmath>` resolves the errors. If other issues arise or if the errors persist, further investigation into the code and possibly the build environment might be necessary.

This step-by-step reasoning ensures that the approach is systematic and focused on addressing the specific errors reported by the HLS compiler, ultimately aiming to achieve a successful compilation and functionality of the HLS code.
