Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Analysis of Compiler Error Log**: 
   The error log from the Vitis HLS compiler specifically flags an issue at line 13 of the `pointer_cast_native.c` file. The log mentions a "missing terminating ' character" followed by an "expected expression" error. This suggests a syntax error related to the use of a single quotation mark.

2. **Identifying the Error in Code**: 
   Upon inspecting the buggy code at line 13, the return statement is written as `return 'result;`. This is clearly a syntax error because the single quote `'` before `result` is not used correctly in C/C++. Typically, single quotes are used for character literals, and their presence here is incorrect and unintended.

3. **Reasoning Behind the Error**:
   The misuse of the single quote seems to be a typographical error. Since `result` is a variable holding the computed result, the correct syntax should simply reference the variable by its name without any quotes.

4. **Proposing a Fix**:
   To fix this error, remove the single quote before `result`. The corrected line should read:
   ```cpp
   return result;
   ```

5. **Reflect and Plan Next Steps**:
   After fixing the syntax error, the next logical step is to recompile the code to check if there are any more errors or if the single change resolves the compilation issues. Given that the syntax error was clear and the rest of the function syntax appears to align with typical C/C++ conventions, it's reasonable to expect that this fix might be sufficient. However, thorough testing and recompilation are essential to confirm this.

In summary, the error was a simple yet impactful syntax mistake with the misuse of a single quote. Correcting this by removing the quote should resolve the compilation error, and the function should then behave as intended. Further validation would be required by recompiling and potentially running any associated tests to ensure functional correctness.
