Chain of Thought (CoT):
```text
1. Error Identification:
   The Vitis HLS compiler error log shows two specific errors related to the use of dynamic memory allocation. The relevant error messages are:
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'loop_imperfect(ap_int<5>*, ap_int<6>*)': Undefined function operator new[] (loop_imperfect.cpp:7:26)"
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'loop_imperfect(ap_int<5>*, ap_int<6>*)': Undefined function operator delete[] (loop_imperfect.cpp:20:5)"
   These errors indicate that the HLS toolchain does not support the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation functions (`new[]` and `delete[]`).

2. Hypothesis Formation:
   Based on the error log, the hypothesis is that High-Level Synthesis (HLS) does not inherently support dynamic memory allocation due to the need for predictable hardware synthesis, which cannot dynamically allocate memory at runtime.

3. Testing and Verification:
   To verify this hypothesis, I referred to the HLS documentation and standards, which confirm that dynamic memory allocation is generally unsupported because HLS aims to convert C/C++ code directly into hardware circuits, and hardware circuits require a fixed amount of resources decided at compile-time.

4. Reflection and Planning Next Steps:
   Given the confirmation that dynamic memory allocation is unsupported in HLS, the next logical step is to remove or modify the lines of code that involve `new[]` and `delete[]`.

5. Fix Proposal:
   - Remove the line `int* dynamic_array = new int[20];` at line 7 in the buggy code.
   - Remove the line `delete[] dynamic_array;` at line 20 in the buggy code.
   This would prevent the HLS tool from attempting to synthesize unsupported dynamic memory operations and align the code more closely with typical HLS practices, which prefer statically allocated arrays or other data structures with fixed size known at compile-time.

6. Reflection on Fix:
   By removing these lines, the code no longer contains any dynamic memory allocation/deallocation and now strictly operates upon the inputs and outputs defined by the function parameters, using simple loops and conditionals which are well-supported in HLS contexts. This change should resolve the synthesis errors and allow successful compilation and synthesis of the code into hardware.

Conclusion:
The debugging process identified that the use of dynamic memory allocation is incompatible with HLS requirements. Removing these elements and relying on static data handling not only resolves the compiler errors but also aligns the code with best practices for hardware synthesis.
