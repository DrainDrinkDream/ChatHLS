Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Error Identification**:
    - The error log indicates a 'Top_Function_Not_Found' bug, suggesting an issue with the function declaration or naming. Specifically, the log mentions an "undefined reference to `loop_sequential_assert(ap_int<8>*, ap_int<8>*, ap_int<13>*, ap_int<13>*, ap_uint<8>, ap_uint<8>)`". This suggests that the expected function `loop_sequential_assert` is not found by the linker.

2. **Analyzing the Buggy Code**:
    - The function in the buggy code is named `sequential_assert`. However, the error log is expecting a function named `loop_sequential_assert`. This mismatch is likely the cause of the error. 
    - Other aspects like function parameters appear consistent with typical HLS data types, and thus, may not be causing the immediate compilation failure.

3. **Proposed Fix**:
    - To resolve this, I should rename the function in the buggy code from `sequential_assert` to `loop_sequential_assert`. This aligns with the function name expected by the compiler/linker as indicated in the error log.

4. **Validation**:
    - By renaming the function, the linker should be able to find the correct reference, which would resolve the 'Top_Function_Not_Found' error. This hypothesis is supported by the error message clearly indicating a missing function of a specific name.

5. **Reflection**:
    - The error was straightforward and primarily involved a naming mismatch. After adjusting the function's name, I will recompile the code. If no further errors are present, this should resolve the problem. If additional errors surface, I would then proceed to diagnose those based on the new compiler output. 

In summary, the error identified was due to a function name mismatch. Correcting this by renaming the function as specified in the error log should resolve the current compilation issue.
