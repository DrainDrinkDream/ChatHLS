Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - I started by examining the compiler error log which pointed out that there were syntax errors in the provided C++ code.
   - The error specifically stated: '../../../../loop_sequential_assert.cpp:17:22: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘Y’'. This shows the compiler expected a semicolon but didn't find it before encountering 'Y'.

2. **Identifying the Faulty Code Line**:
   - Focusing on the error message, I referred to the line in the buggy code: `Y_accum += B[i]`.
   - Immediately after this line, I noticed that the semicolon `;` was missing at the end of the statement.

3. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - The absence of a semicolon in C++ can cause the compiler to not recognize the end of a statement, leading it to continue reading into the next line. This is likely why the compiler flagged an unexpected token (`Y`) because it was parsing part of an incomplete statement.

4. **Proposed Fix**:
   - To resolve this error, I need to add a semicolon at the end of the line `Y_accum += B[i];` to properly terminate the statement.

5. **Further Analysis for Additional Errors**:
   - I continued to check if there were any other similar issues. I found another syntax issue on the line right after the previously identified one: `Y[i] = Y_accum`.
   - This line was also missing a semicolon at the end.

6. **Propose Further Fixes**:
   - Similarly, I added a semicolon at the end of `Y[i] = Y_accum;` to ensure that this statement is properly terminated.

7. **Reflection on Fixes**:
   - After adding semicolons to both lines where they were missing, the syntax of the code should now conform to C++ standards, and the compiler should be able to proceed without the previously encountered syntax errors.

8. **Verification**:
   - Assuming these changes are made, the next logical step would be to recompile the code. I would anticipate that the particular compilation error pointed out by the log should no longer occur.

9. **Conclusion and Next Steps**:
   - With the syntax errors corrected, I would proceed to check if there are any logical errors or further syntax issues once the code compiles successfully. However, based on the current error log, only the missing semicolons needed immediate attention. 

By following these detailed steps, I systematically addressed the issues highlighted by the compiler error log and proposed the necessary corrections to the buggy HLS code.
