**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Analysis of Error Log**:
   - The Vitis HLS compiler error log states that there is an error: `'undefined_objectâ€™ was not declared in this scope`.
   - This error points to line 56 in the provided code snippet: `write_result(undefined_object, outStream, vSize);`.
   - This suggests that the identifier `undefined_object` is not recognized by the compiler, indicating that it probably is a typo or incorrect variable name.

2. **Investigation of the Suspected Line**:
   - Upon examining the line `write_result(undefined_object, outStream, vSize);`, it's clear that the first argument passed to the function `write_result` should be a pointer to an output array where results will be stored.
   - The term `undefined_object` does not match any variable declaration or type in the provided code snippet, which confirms why the compiler is unable to recognize it.

3. **Cross-Referencing with Similar Functions**:
   - When looking at similar functions such as `read_input` that takes as first argument `uint32_t* in`, it becomes evident that the function `write_result` should similarly be taking a pointer to the array where the results are meant to be stored.
   - The correct variable to be passed should logically be the output array `out`, which is intended to store the results from the stream processing.

4. **Proposed Fix**:
   - Replace `undefined_object` with `out` in the function call to `write_result` on line 56.
   - The corrected line should read: `write_result(out, outStream, vSize);`.

5. **Reflection and Validation**:
   - This correction aligns with the typical usage pattern observed in other parts of similar HLS code where pointers to data arrays are passed to functions handling input/output operations.
   - The fix should resolve the compilation error as `out` is a defined and appropriate variable for this context which matches the expected type (pointer to `uint32_t`).

6. **Plan for Further Actions**:
   - After making the proposed fix, recompile the code using the Vitis HLS tool to ensure that the compilation error is resolved.
   - If other issues arise during recompilation, analyze and address them following a similar logical approach.

By following these detailed steps, the error in the HLS code is identified and corrected effectively, ensuring accurate functionality and compatibility with the HLS tool requirements.
