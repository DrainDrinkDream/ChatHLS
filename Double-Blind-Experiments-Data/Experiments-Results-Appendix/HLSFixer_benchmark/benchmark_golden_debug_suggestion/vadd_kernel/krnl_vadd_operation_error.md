**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Error Examination:**
   - The error log specifies a failure during simulation with a non-zero return value, which indicates a potential logical or runtime error in the code rather than a compilation or syntax error.

2. **Analysis of Compute Add Function:**
   - In the `compute_add` function, the operation performed is subtraction between the two input streams (`inStream1.read() - inStream2.read()`). Assuming the original intent of the kernel is to perform vector addition (based on the function name `krnl_vadd` which suggests vector addition), this is likely incorrect.
   - Logical Misalignment Hypothesis: The subtraction instead of addition could potentially lead to unexpected results, especially if the test expects addition results. This discrepancy would ultimately lead to a non-zero return value during the simulation phase due to mismatched results against expected outputs.

3. **Proposed Fix for Compute Add Function:**
   - Change the subtraction operation to addition in the `compute_add` function to align with the expected functionality:
     ```cpp
     outStream << (inStream1.read() + inStream2.read());
     ```

4. **Verification of Pragma Directives:**
   - The pragma directive `#pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min = size max = size` uses the identifier `size` which is not declared or defined within the function scopes. This could potentially be a mistake or carryover from template code.
   - Fix Hypothesis: Replace `size` with `vSize` which is the actual parameter controlling the loop iterations:
     ```cpp
     #pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min = vSize max = vSize
     ```

5. **Further Investigation:**
   - There are no syntax or interface errors indicated in the provided logs. All other parts of the code such as the dataflow pragma and the AXI interface pragmas appear to be correctly configured for typical HLS synthesis tasks.

6. **Reflection and Next Steps:**
   - After implementing the logical fix in the `compute_add` function and correcting the `LOOP_TRIPCOUNT` pragmas, re-run the simulation to validate if the error regarding non-zero exit codes is resolved.
   - Ensure to retest extensively to catch any other potential discrepancies that might not be evident from initial error logs.

By addressing both the logical error in the computation function and the potential misuse of pragmas, the HLS code should align closer to expected functional behavior and pass the simulation phase without errors.
