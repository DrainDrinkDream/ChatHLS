Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Inspection and Error Log Analysis**:
    - The error log highlights a syntax error in the `compute_add` function. Specifically, it mentions an expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token on line 25.

2. **Identifying the Error**:
    - I look at the specified line in the `compute_add` function:
      ```cpp
      outStream << (inStream1.read() + inStream2.read())
      ```
      This line lacks a semicolon (`;`) at the end, which is a basic syntax requirement in C++ for statement termination.

3. **Hypothesizing the Cause of the Error**:
    - This is clearly a syntax oversight. Missing a semicolon is a common mistake that can easily slip through during coding, especially if the code is modified or written in a hurry.

4. **Proposing a Fix**:
    - To resolve this error, I simply need to add a semicolon at the end of the line:
      ```cpp
      outStream << (inStream1.read() + inStream2.read());
      ```
    - This will correctly terminate the statement and should clear the syntax error reported by the HLS compiler.

5. **Testing and Verification**:
    - After adding the semicolon, the code should be recompiled to check if this resolves the compilation error. Since this is the only error reported by the HLS compiler, fixing it should make the code compatible with HLS constraints and syntax rules.

6. **Reflection**:
    - The error was straightforward and localized to a single line, making it easy to identify and correct. Ensuring every statement is properly terminated with a semicolon is a fundamental rule in C++ which must be diligently followed to avoid syntax errors.
    - It's also a reminder of the importance of thorough code reviews and possibly integrating automated linting tools in the development environment to catch such simple errors early in the development process.

This debugging process highlights the importance of adhering to basic syntax rules and the efficacy of detailed compiler error logs in guiding the debugging process.
