**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Identification**:
   - From the compiler error logs, we can see a warning: "WARNING: Hls::stream 'input_stream_1' contains leftover data, which may result in RTL simulation hanging." This implies that the stream handling or data processing may not be correctly synchronized or that data is not processed as expected.

2. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - Based on the warning about leftover data in 'input_stream_1', it's reasonable to hypothesize that data is either not being read from the stream at the rate it's being written, or it's not being written and read consistently across the streams.
   - Reviewing the `compute_add` function in the buggy code, it's observed that the function reads only from `inStream2` and ignores `inStream1`. This could lead to unprocessed data in `inStream1` which aligns with the warning in the error log. Additionally, the sum computation using `uint32_t sum = 0;` then adding only `inStream2` data is logically incorrect as it doesn't use the data from `inStream1`.

3. **Validation through Analysis**:
   - The error log's warning about leftover data in `input_stream_1` directly correlates with the observation that data from `inStream1` is not being used in the `compute_add` function. This would naturally result in leftover data in this stream since it is filled in `read_input` but not adequately emptied.

4. **Proposal for Fix**:
   - To fix this, modify the `compute_add` function to correctly process data from both input streams (`inStream1` and `inStream2`). This should address the functional inconsistency and the warning of leftover data. The sum in `compute_add` should be computed as the sum of data from both streams:
   ```cpp
   static void compute_add(hls::stream<uint32_t>& inStream1,
                           hls::stream<uint32_t>& inStream2,
                           hls::stream<uint32_t>& outStream, int vSize) {

   execute:
       for (int i = 0; i < vSize; i++) {
   #pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min = size max = size
           
           outStream << (inStream1.read() + inStream2.read());
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Reflection**:
   - By addressing the logical error in the `compute_add` function, the data from both streams will be processed correctly, likely resolving the warning about leftover data and ensuring that the computation reflects the intended sum of two input streams. This will also likely resolve the simulation failure since the streams are now being synchronized and processed as expected. 

6. **Next Steps**:
   - After applying the proposed fix, it would be necessary to re-run the HLS simulation to validate that the fix resolves the issue without introducing new errors. Ensuring that all streams are properly synchronized and that the data is processed as expected is crucial for the correct operation in an HLS environment.
