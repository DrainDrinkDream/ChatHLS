**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the Error**:
   - The error log from the Vitis HLS compiler indicates an issue in the `compute_add` function. Specifically, the log points out a syntax error with an unclosed parenthesis at the line where `outStream` is used to store the result of the addition of two stream reads.
   - The error message specifies: 
     ```
     '../../../../krnl_vadd.cpp:25:58: error: expected ‘)’ before ‘;’ token\n', '         outStream << (inStream1.read() + inStream2.read();\n'
     ```
   - This clearly suggests a missing closing parenthesis.

2. **Analysis of the Error**:
   - Given the error message, it is evident that the syntax for the expression inside the stream insertion operation is incorrect due to a missing closing parenthesis.
   - By examining the line mentioned in the error message:
     ```cpp
     outStream << (inStream1.read() + inStream2.read();
     ```
     It becomes apparent that the intended operation was to add the values read from two input streams and then write the resulting sum to the output stream. However, due to the missing parenthesis, the expression is syntactically incorrect.

3. **Proposing a Fix**:
   - To correct this syntax error, I need to add a closing parenthesis at the end of the expression before the semicolon. This would correctly encapsulate the arithmetic operation within the stream insertion syntax.
   - The corrected line should look like:
     ```cpp
     outStream << (inStream1.read() + inStream2.read());
     ```

4. **Reflection**:
   - The syntax error in the expression was straightforward to identify and rectify using the error log from the compiler. The clear indication of an expected ‘)’ before the ‘;’ token was a direct hint towards the missing parenthesis.
   - Fixing this error should resolve the compilation error and allow the simulation (`C-SIM`) to proceed without the syntactical interruption.
   - After applying this fix, it would be prudent to recompile and rerun the simulation to ensure no other syntactic or logical errors remain in the code.
   - As this was the only error highlighted by the compiler and no other issues were indicated in the subsequent steps of synthesis or co-simulation, it's highly likely that resolving this issue will make the code compatible with the HLS requirements.

This step-by-step analysis and the application of a targeted fix based on the compiler's feedback should adequately address the problem presented and ensure the functionality of the HLS code.
