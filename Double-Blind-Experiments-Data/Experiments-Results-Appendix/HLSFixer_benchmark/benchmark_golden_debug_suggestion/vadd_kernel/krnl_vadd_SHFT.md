**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Analysis from Compiler Log:**
   The compiler error log indicates a warning about a left shift operation: "left shift count >= width of type [-Wshift-count-overflow]". This occurs in the `read_input` function at the line:
   ```cpp
   inStream << (in[i] << 32);
   ```
   This suggests that the left shift operation is trying to shift `uint32_t` values by 32 bits, which is equal to the bit width of the type, leading to an undefined behavior or overflow.

2. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   Given the error message, it's likely that the intent was not to shift the entire 32-bit value out of its original bit-width. Instead, the operation was probably intended to pass the unmodified `uint32_t` value into the stream. The use of the left shift by 32 bits is likely a mistake.

3. **Testing the Hypothesis:**
   Removing the left shift operation should resolve the warning. This change would align with typical operations where values are directly passed into streams without modification, especially if the streams are intended to carry the same type as the input array.

4. **Proposed Fix:**
   Modify the line in `read_input` function to:
   ```cpp
   inStream << in[i];
   ```
   This change simply passes the `uint32_t` values from the input array directly into the stream.

5. **Further Analysis Based on Log:**
   The log also contains multiple warnings about potential deadlocks due to streams' default sizes. It advises considering resizing the streams using 'set_directive_stream' or 'HLS stream' pragma to avoid potential deadlocks.
   
6. **Hypothesis for Stream Resizing:**
   By default, the streams might not be adequately sized to handle the data being passed in and out, especially under different or maximum `vSize` conditions which could lead to blocking if the stream is full.

7. **Proposed Fix for Stream Sizes:**
   To address this, we can add directives to specify the depth of each stream. This can be done by adding the following lines near the stream declarations:
   ```cpp
   #pragma HLS STREAM variable=inStream1 depth=1024
   #pragma HLS STREAM variable=inStream2 depth=1024
   #pragma HLS STREAM variable=outStream depth=1024
   ```
   This modification specifies that each stream can hold up to 1024 elements before blocking, which should help in preventing deadlocks in most practical scenarios.

8. **Reflection and Next Steps:**
   With the critical shift operation error resolved and potential deadlocks mitigated by specifying stream depths, the code should now be more robust and compatible with HLS requirements. The next step would be to recompile the code, ensure that the error and warnings are resolved, and perform functional simulation to verify correctness.

This sequence of debugging steps should address the primary issues indicated in the compiler error log and improve the overall functionality and reliability of the HLS design.
