**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the Error**:
   The HLS compiler error log indicates that there are warnings about the `hls::stream` objects `input_stream_1` and `input_stream_2` being read while empty, which might cause RTL simulation hanging. This suggests a problem with how data is being managed and processed through these streams.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   In the buggy code, the function `read_input()` iterates through the input array `in` with a step of 2 (`i+=2`). This means it pushes only half of the input data into `inStream`. Consequently, when `compute_add()` tries to read from these streams, it encounters a shortage of data, which leads to the streams being empty at certain points during the computation.

3. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   Based on the structure of the loop in `read_input()`, it's hypothesized that the modification from a step of 1 (as might be expected to process each element of the input array) to a step of 2 is the likely cause of the error. This stepping leads to fewer data points being pushed into the streams than are expected to be read, thus causing the streams to be read while empty.

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   By examining the correct processing flow, it should ensure that each element of the input arrays `in1` and `in2` is read and pushed into their respective streams. The loop in `read_input()` should iterate through each index from 0 to `vSize-1` without skipping any elements. This will ensure that the streams have the correct amount of data to be processed in `compute_add()`.

5. **Proposed Fix**:
   Modify the loop increment in `read_input()` from `i+=2` to `i++`. This change ensures that every element of the input arrays is read and pushed into the streams, thus preventing the streams from being empty when they are read.

6. **Reflection and Next Steps**:
   After making this correction, recompile the code. If the warning about the streams being read while empty disappears and the RTL simulation does not hang, the fix can be considered successful. It would also be prudent to check if there are any further logical errors or inefficiencies in the code.

**Code Modification**:
   Change the `read_input()` function from:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < vSize; i+=2) {
       inStream << in[i];
   }
   ```
   to:
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < vSize; i++) {
       inStream << in[i];
   }
   ```

This debugging strategy, based on the analysis of the given buggy code and the corresponding compiler error log, should resolve the issue of the streams being read while empty and prevent the RTL simulation from hanging.
