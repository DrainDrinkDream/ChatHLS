**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the Error:**
   The error log points out that there's an issue with `'undefined_function' was not declared in this scope`. This suggests that the function `undefined_function()` is being called but has not been defined or declared anywhere in the provided code. This is a straightforward compilation error where the program is referring to a function that the compiler has no knowledge about.

2. **Analyzing the Reasons for the Error:**
   The issue here is clear from the error message: the function `undefined_function()` is not known to the compiler. This can happen when the function is either mistakenly called, or it was intended to be implemented but was left out. In either case, the reference to this function causes the compilation to fail because the function lacks a declaration and definition.

3. **Proposing Fixes:**
   To resolve this issue, we need to check the purpose of this function call. If it was intended for debugging or was mistakenly left in the production code, it should be removed. Given that no other part of the provided code or the functionality described (vector addition) requires this function, it's safe to assume it was not meant to be part of the final code.
   
   **Fix:** Remove the line `undefined_function();` from the `krnl_vadd` function.

4. **Reflecting on the Findings:**
   By removing this erroneous function call, the code should now compile successfully. This fix addresses the direct cause of the compilation error as identified in the error log. The rest of the code looks consistent with typical HLS patterns for streaming data and performing operations, and there are no other errors reported by the compiler, suggesting no further syntactic or functional issues.

5. **Planning Next Steps:**
   After making the proposed fix, the next logical step would be to recompile the code. If the compilation passes without further errors, it would be prudent to run a simulation to ensure the functional correctness of the changes and the overall design. This simulation would validate that data is correctly read from the inputs, processed, and written to the output without any runtime issues.

**Conclusion:**
This debugging process, grounded on the compiler error log and the nature of the function call error, leads to a clear resolution path by removing the undefined function call, which does not align with the required functionality of the vector addition kernel.
