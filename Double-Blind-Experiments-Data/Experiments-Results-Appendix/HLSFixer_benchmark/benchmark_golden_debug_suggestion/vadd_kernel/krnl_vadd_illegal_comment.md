**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the Error:**
   - The Vitis HLS compiler error log points directly to a syntax error in the code. Specifically, the error message `'../../../../krnl_vadd.cpp:60:1: error: expected unqualified-id before ‘/’ token'` suggests there is something wrong around line 60 related to a '/' token.
   - Examining the code around line 60, we notice the line `// This is an illegal comment that will cause a syntax error` is mistakenly started with a single slash (`/`) instead of double slashes (`//`). This is causing the compiler to misinterpret the line as code rather than a comment, leading to a syntax error.

2. **Analyzing the Reason for the Error:**
   - The bug is a simple typographical error where a comment was incorrectly initiated with a single slash (`/`) instead of double slashes (`//`). This leads to the compiler error as it does not recognize this as a comment and instead attempts to interpret it as C++ code.

3. **Propose a Fix:**
   - To fix this error, modify the line from `/ This is an illegal comment that will cause a syntax error` to `// This is an illegal comment that will cause a syntax error`. This will ensure that the line is correctly recognized as a comment and ignored by the compiler.

4. **Testing and Verification:**
   - After correcting the comment syntax, recompile the program. The expectation is that this syntax error will no longer appear in the compiler error log, confirming the fix was successful.
   - Ensure no other syntax or logical errors are present post this correction by checking the compiler logs and running any necessary tests to validate the functionality.

5. **Reflection:**
   - The error in this scenario was straightforward to diagnose and correct due to the explicit nature of syntax errors and their direct indication in compiler error logs.
   - It's crucial to always ensure proper syntax, especially in comments, which are often overlooked, to avoid such compilation issues.
   - After correcting the comment, reviewing and recompiling the code is essential to confirm that the fix resolves the issue without introducing new ones. 

By following these steps, the syntax error identified by the Vitis HLS compiler is resolved, and further checks should confirm the functional correctness of the code.
