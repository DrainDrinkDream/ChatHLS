**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the Error:**
   - The error log points to a specific line in the `matmul_partition.cpp` file:
     ```
     '../../../../matmul_partition.cpp:64:40: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token\n', 
     '         out_r[itr] = C[i * MAX_DIM + j]\n', 
     ```
   - This indicates a syntax error where a semicolon (`;`) is missing at the end of the line.

2. **Analyzing the Reason for Error:**
   - In C/C++, every statement must end with a semicolon. The missing semicolon at the end of the assignment statement within the `writeC` loop causes the compiler to fail, as it cannot correctly parse the end of the statement.

3. **Proposing a Fix:**
   - To resolve this error, a semicolon should be added at the end of the line where it's missing:
     ```cpp
     out_r[itr] = C[i * MAX_DIM + j];
     ```
   - This change completes the syntax of the statement and should allow the compiler to successfully parse the code.

4. **Reflecting on the Findings and Next Steps:**
   - After adding the semicolon, the syntax error is addressed. We need to recompile the code to check if there are any more errors or if further modifications are required.
   - Assuming the rest of the code has been transcribed correctly from the original design, this syntax fix should be sufficient to pass the compilation phase and move forward with simulation and synthesis in the HLS tool. If further errors or logical issues are encountered, a similar step-by-step analysis will be required to resolve them.

By following this detailed chain of thought, we have pinpointed the syntax error from the compiler's feedback, understood why it occurred, and corrected it to ensure proper compilation and further analysis in the HLS workflow.
