Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Observation and Compilation Error Analysis**: 
    - The error log indicates a compilation error related to an undefined method `optimizeMatmul()`. This method call appears in the code but is not declared anywhere in the provided snippet or within any included headers. The error message is `'../../../../matmul_partition.cpp:69:5: error: ‘optimizeMatmul’ was not declared in this scope'`. This points directly to the need for either defining this function or removing the call if it's not necessary.

2. **Reflecting on the Undefined Method**:
    - Given that the function `optimizeMatmul()` is not defined or declared, and no additional files or libraries containing this function are mentioned, it's rational to hypothesize that this function call might be a remnant from a previous version of the code or used for debugging purposes and was mistakenly left in the codebase.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
    - To address the compilation error, the first step is to search through all provided files and headers for the definition of `optimizeMatmul()`. If the function definition is nowhere to be found, the logical step is to remove the call to this function.
    - If the function is essential for the operation (unlikely given the lack of definition and declaration), it would need to be properly defined or the appropriate header or library included.

4. **Proposed Fix Based on Observations**:
    - Since there is no definition for `optimizeMatmul()` and no indications of it being part of included libraries or headers, the most straightforward fix is to remove the line of code calling `optimizeMatmul();` from the `matmul_partition()` function.
    - This change would involve simply commenting out or deleting line 69 in the provided code.

5. **Reflection on the Outcome**:
    - After removing or commenting out the call to the undefined function, the code should be recompiled to check if this resolves the compilation error. Presuming there are no other hidden issues or missing dependencies, this should clear the compilation error and allow for further testing and validation of the function's functionality.

6. **Further Considerations**:
    - Post-fixing the compilation error, it would be prudent to check and ensure the logical integrity of the matrix multiplication and ensure that all other parts of the code (such as the array partitions and loop optimizations) are functioning as expected.
    - Running simulations and synthesis with test cases will help confirm that the matrix multiplication is performed correctly and efficiently.

This debugging process, centered on addressing the specific compilation error highlighted in the log, should resolve the immediate issue preventing the code from compiling and allow for further functional and performance validation.
