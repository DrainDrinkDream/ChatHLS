**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Step 1: Analyzing Compiler Errors**
   - The error log indicates issues with the functions `sqrt` and `pow` not being declared. These functions are part of the C++ standard library and typically require the inclusion of `<cmath>` for their declarations. 

2. **Step 2: Hypothesizing Causes**
   - The error messages suggest that the functions `sqrt` and `pow` require their respective headers to be included but are missing. This is consistent with typical C++ compilation errors when trying to use standard library functions without including the appropriate headers.
   - It is also worth noting that the use of `double` data type in the declaration of arrays `A`, `B`, and `C` could be non-optimal or incompatible with the intended use of these arrays, particularly in the context of hardware synthesis where fixed-size integer types are more predictable in behavior.

3. **Step 3: Proposing Fixes based on Hypotheses**
   - **Fix for Missing Declarations**:
     - Include the `<cmath>` header at the beginning of the file to provide the necessary declarations for `sqrt` and `pow`.
     ```cpp
     #include <cmath>
     ```
   - **Potential Data Type Issue**:
     - Since hardware synthesis tools like Vitis HLS often handle integer arithmetic more efficiently and predictably than floating-point arithmetic, consider changing the data types of `A`, `B`, and `C` from `double` to `int`, if the application logic allows. Note that this will also require changing the assignments to these arrays from using `sqrt` and `pow` to direct assignments or other integer operations.

4. **Step 4: Addressing Each Bug**
   - **Bug 1**: 'sqrt' was not declared in this scope.
     - **Reason**: The standard math functions are not accessible because the `<cmath>` library is not included.
     - **Fix**: Add `#include <cmath>` at the top of the file.
   - **Bug 2**: 'pow' was not declared in this scope.
     - The same fix as for `sqrt` applies, ensuring that `<cmath>` is included.
   - **Additional Consideration**: The use of `double` might not be ideal for synthesis. This would require a deeper review of the algorithm's requirements and possibly replacing `double` with `int` and adjusting calculations accordingly.

5. **Step 5: Reflecting on Fixes**
   - After adding the `<cmath>` include, recompile the code to check if the errors regarding `sqrt` and `pow` are resolved.
   - Consider whether the algorithm appropriately handles data types, especially in the context of FPGA synthesis, where integer operations are usually preferred for performance and resource considerations.

6. **Step 6: Planning Further Actions**
   - If further errors or warnings are observed post-fix, analyze them in the context of data types and operations used.
   - Perform functional simulation (C-SIM) to ensure that the behavioral changes (if any from fixing data types) do not affect the algorithm's correctness.

This detailed step-by-step reasoning should guide the debugging of the provided HLS C++ code effectively, addressing both the immediate compilation errors and considering broader implications for hardware synthesis compatibility.
