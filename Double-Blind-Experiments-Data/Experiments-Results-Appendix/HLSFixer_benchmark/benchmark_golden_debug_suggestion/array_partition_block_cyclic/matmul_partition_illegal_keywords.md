**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Observation and Error Identification**:
   - First, I reviewed the error log which highlighted two specific errors both associated with the keyword `let` in the loop definition:
     ```
     '../../../../matmul_partition.cpp:49:22: error: ‘let’ was not declared in this scope
     '../../../../matmul_partition.cpp:49:33: error: ‘k’ was not declared in this scope
     ```
   - From these errors, it's clear that the compiler does not recognize `let` as a valid keyword in C++. This indicates a syntax error in the loop definition.

2. **Analyzing the Erroneous Code**:
   - Inspecting the line where the error occurs:
     ```cpp
     for (let k = 0; k < MAX_DIM; k++) {
     ```
   - In C++, the correct keyword for declaring variables in a loop is `int` not `let`. The `let` keyword is used in other programming languages like JavaScript, which explains the syntax error.

3. **Proposed Fix**:
   - To resolve this error, replace `let` with `int` in the loop initialization:
     ```cpp
     for (int k = 0; k < MAX_DIM; k++) {
     ```
   - This change aligns with the correct syntax for variable declaration within a loop in C++ and should eliminate the compiler errors.

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   - After making the correction, the next logical step would be to recompile the code. This would verify if the syntax error was the sole issue or if there are further errors or logical issues in the code.
   - Assuming the syntax error was the only issue, fixing it should allow the compiler to successfully compile the program, moving past the previously encountered errors.

5. **Reflection and Further Actions**:
   - Reflecting on this debugging process, the primary takeaway is the importance of using correct language syntax and being wary of simple typographical errors that can lead to compilation failures.
   - If further errors were to arise post-fix, a similar methodical approach would be employed to debug step by step, ensuring each part of the code conforms to C++ standards and HLS compatibility requirements. 

This step-by-step debugging ensures thorough correction of the identified errors and reinforces the diligence required in programming for specialized applications like HLS.
