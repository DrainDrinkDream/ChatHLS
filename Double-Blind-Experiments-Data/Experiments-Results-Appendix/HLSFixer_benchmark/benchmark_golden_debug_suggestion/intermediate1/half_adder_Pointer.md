Chain of Thought (CoT):
```text
1. **Identify Errors**:
   - The compiler error log shows errors related to the use of `operator new` and `operator delete` in the `half_adder` function. Specifically, the errors are at lines 4, 5, 14, and 15 of the buggy code.

2. **Analyze Reasons**:
   - **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The use of `new` and `delete` for dynamic memory allocation is not compatible with HLS. The HLS toolset doesn't support dynamic memory operations because hardware design requires fixed resources. 
   - **Error Details**: The error log clearly states "Undefined function operator new" and "Undefined function operator delete," indicating these operations are unsupported in HLS.
   - **Incorrect Use**: In the context of HLS, operations should be performed directly on the provided pointers without dynamic memory allocation.

3. **Propose Fixes**:
   - Remove the `new` and `delete` operations and directly use the `sum` and `cout` pointers to store the results.
   - Updated Code:
     ```cpp
     #include "half_adder.h"

     void half_adder(bool a, bool b, bool *sum, bool *cout) {
         *sum = a ^ b;    // Directly compute sum
         *cout = a & b;   // Directly compute carry-out
     }
     ```

4. **Sequential Reasoning**:
   - Start by addressing the syntax errors related to `new` and `delete` operations as flagged by the compiler. These are fundamental issues that need resolution before proceeding with any other logic checks.

5. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - The logical error hypothesis is based on the incompatibility of dynamic memory operations with HLS. The operations are unnecessary for implementing the half-adder logic, which can be directly computed using the given pointers.

6. **Testing and Verification**:
   - By removing the dynamic memory operations and directly using the pointers, the code aligns with HLS requirements. This modification should resolve the synthesis issues.

7. **Reflection**:
   - After addressing the syntax errors, reflect on the necessity of dynamic memory in the original algorithm. The logic of the half-adder doesn't require dynamic memory allocation, thus simplifying the implementation aligns with both functional correctness and HLS compatibility.
   - Plan further testing by re-synthesizing the code in HLS to ensure the changes resolve the errors.

By following this structured approach, we systematically address and resolve the issues highlighted by the error log, ensuring the code is compatible with HLS requirements.
