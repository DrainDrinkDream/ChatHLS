**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Step 1: Identifying the Error**
   - **Error Message Analysis**: The error message from the Vitis HLS compiler log points to a specific line in the code: `../../../../half_adder.cpp:7:12: error: type ‘bool’ argument given to ‘delete’, expected pointer`. This error indicates the incorrect usage of the `delete` keyword with a non-pointer type (`bool` in this case).
   
2. **Step 2: Analyzing the Code**
   - **Code Review**: The buggy line in the code is `delete a;` in the function `void half_adder(bool a, bool b, bool *sum, bool *cout)`. Here, `a` is a boolean variable, not a pointer. The `delete` keyword is used in C++ to deallocate memory that was allocated with `new`. Since `a` is not dynamically allocated nor a pointer, using `delete` on `a` is semantically incorrect and thus raises a compilation error.
   
3. **Step 3: Hypothesizing the Reason for Error**
   - **Understanding Use of `delete`**: Typically, `delete` is used to prevent memory leaks by freeing dynamically allocated memory. In this context, it appears to be a misuse or misunderstanding of memory management. The variable `a` is passed by value into the function and not created with `new`, so there’s no need to delete or deallocate it.

4. **Step 4: Proposing a Fix**
   - **Correction Strategy**: To resolve the error, the line `delete a;` should be completely removed from the function. There's no dynamically allocated memory that needs to be freed in this function, and all variables are managed automatically (automatic storage duration).

5. **Step 5: Reflection and Validation**
   - **Reflecting on the Impact of the Change**: Removing the `delete a;` line should not affect the logic of the function. The function should correctly compute the sum and carry-out as intended, performing bitwise XOR for sum and bitwise AND for carry-out, storing the results through pointer dereferencing.
   
6. **Step 6: Next Steps**
   - **Recompiling**: After removing the erroneous line, recompiling the code using Vitis HLS would be the next logical step. This is expected to clear the error and allow simulation and synthesis processes to proceed without the `illegal_keywords` error.

By following this detailed reasoning and correction strategy, the code should become compatible with HLS requirements and free of the specific compilation error highlighted by the HLS toolchain.
