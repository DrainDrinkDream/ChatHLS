Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Error Analysis**:
   - Upon examining the Vitis HLS compiler error log, it's evident that the use of dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete`) is causing errors. The log explicitly mentions "Undefined function operator new" and "Undefined function operator delete" at specific lines in the half_adder function. 
   - Dynamic memory allocation is not suitable for synthesis in an HLS context because it introduces non-determinism and inefficiencies not compatible with hardware circuitry, which prefers static allocation.

2. **Understanding the Errors in Detail**:
   - The error messages pinpoint the issue at lines 4, 5 for `new` and lines 13, 14 for `delete`. These lines attempt to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory for pointers `dynamic_sum` and `dynamic_cout`.
   - This approach is incorrect for HLS as it might work in a standard C++ simulation environment (C-SIM passed) but fails during synthesis (C-SYNTH failed) where the behavior must be converted into hardware logic.

3. **Proposed Fixes**:
   - Instead of using dynamic memory allocation, use direct pointer assignments. The operations on these pointers are straightforward and can be directly handled by assigning values to the pointers passed as arguments to the function.
   - Modify the code to eliminate the use of `new` and `delete`, and directly work with the input pointer arguments `sum` and `cout`.

4. **Code Modifications**:
   - Remove lines 4 and 5 where `dynamic_sum` and `dynamic_cout` are declared and dynamically allocated.
   - Remove lines 13 and 14 where dynamically allocated memory is deleted.
   - Modify lines 7 and 8 to directly assign the results to `*sum` and `*cout`.

5. **Reflection and Verification**:
   - These modifications should align the function's behavior with the original HLS-compatible code, which directly assigns values to the output pointers. 
   - By removing dynamic memory operations, the function becomes deterministic and synthesis-friendly, adhering to HLS requirements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The fixed function avoids dynamic memory allocation and adheres to HLS standards, making it suitable for synthesis into hardware logic.
   - This method should resolve the synthesis errors reported by the Vitis HLS compiler and ensure that the function behaves correctly both in simulation and synthesis environments.
