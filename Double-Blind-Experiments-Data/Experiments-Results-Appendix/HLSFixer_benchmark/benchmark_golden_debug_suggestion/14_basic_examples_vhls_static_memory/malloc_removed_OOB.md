**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Identification**:
   From the error log and the code, it appears there is a discrepancy between the expected results and the actual results, causing simulation failure. A primary suspect in such cases is often out-of-bound (OOB) memory access. Let's deep dive into the loops where the array indexing is happening, as these are common areas for such errors.

2. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   Looking at the loops, the terminating conditions `i <= N-1` and `j <= N` in the `LOOP_SHIFT` and `LOOP_ACCUM` loops respectively stand out. Usually, in C/C++, arrays are zero-indexed, and iterating till `<= N-1` and `<= N` can potentially lead to accessing an index out of the array's bounds. 

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   - In the `LOOP_SHIFT` loop: The condition should ideally be `i < N` to ensure that `i` ranges from `0` to `N-1`. However, the current condition `i <= N-1` also iterates from `0` to `N-1`. Thus, this is not an error.
   - In the `LOOP_ACCUM` loop: The loop condition `j <= N` will attempt to access `array_local[N]`, which is out of bounds for an array declared with `int _array_local[64];` and expected to have indices `0` to `N-1`. This is likely the cause of the simulation failure.

4. **Propose Fixes**:
   - For the `LOOP_ACCUM` loop: Change the condition from `j <= N` to `j < N`. This will ensure that the loop does not try to access beyond the valid index range of the array, thus preventing out-of-bound access.

5. **Reflection**:
   After adjusting the loop condition in `LOOP_ACCUM`, it is expected that the simulation discrepancy and failure flagged in the error log would be resolved. It's important to rerun the simulation after the fix to verify that the issue is completely addressed.

**Modified Code Snippet**:
```cpp
  LOOP_ACCUM:for (j=0; j<N; j++) {
      *out_accum += *(array_local+j);
  }
```

This correction should make the function behave as intended and pass the simulation tests, matching the expected results without running into out-of-bound accesses that could corrupt memory or cause erratic behavior.
