**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Analysis of Error Log:**
   The compiler error log indicates a compilation error pointing to an "undeclared identifier 'array_local_'". Specifically, the compiler suggests that 'array_local_' might be a typo and should be 'array_local'. This is a strong hint that there might be a typo in the access to an array or pointer.

2. **Identification of Problematic Code:**
   From the error log, the specific line causing the issue is:
   ```cpp
   *(array_local_+i)=din[i];
   ```
   The compiler is unable to recognize `array_local_`, which is mentioned in the error message. This suggests there is a typo in the variable name.

3. **Comparison and Hypothesis Formation:**
   On examining the snippet, it becomes apparent that `array_local_` should be `array_local` as used elsewhere in the code. The underscore seems to be a typographical error. The mention of "did you mean 'array_local'?" in the error log supports this hypothesis.

4. **Proposed Fix:**
   To resolve the compilation error, change:
   ```cpp
   *(array_local_+i)=din[i];
   ```
   to:
   ```cpp
   *(array_local+i)=din[i];
   ```
   This correction removes the undeclared identifier and uses the correctly declared pointer `array_local`.

5. **Testing and Verification:**
   After making the above change, recompile the code to verify that the error regarding the undeclared identifier is resolved. This would ensure that the typo was the source of the error and that it has been corrected.

6. **Reflection and Conclusion:**
   The error was due to a simple typo which led to the undeclared identifier issue. Fixing the typo should resolve the compilation error as indicated by the error log, making the code syntactically correct. Further testing would be required to ensure there are no additional logical errors in the code.
