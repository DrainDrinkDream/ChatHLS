Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Starting point**: Begin with the error log, which points out two specific syntax errors involving missing semicolons.

2. **First error analysis**:
   - **Error mentioned**: "error: expected ';' after expression" pointing to the line `*out_accum += *(array_local+j)`.
   - **Reasoning**: In C/C++, all statements must end with a semicolon to denote the end of the statement. This error suggests that the semicolon is missing at the end of this line.
   - **Fix**: Add a semicolon at the end of this line.

3. **Second error analysis**:
   - **Error mentioned**: "error: expected ';' after return statement" pointing to the line `return *out_accum`.
   - **Reasoning**: Similar to the first error, this line also lacks a semicolon at the end, which is mandatory to complete the return statement.
   - **Fix**: Add a semicolon at the end of this return statement.

4. **Verification step**:
   - After fixing these syntax errors by adding semicolons, recheck the code to ensure no similar syntax errors are present. The presence of these two errors indicates a chance of overlooking such simple syntax requirements elsewhere, but given the specifics of the error log, it seems these were the only instances.

5. **Reflection**:
   - The errors identified were basic syntax errors, which are typically easy to catch with a careful review of the code. Errors like these could be avoided by using a linter or more thorough manual inspection before compiling.
   - The process of debugging highlighted the importance of attention to detail in syntax in programming languages like C/C++, where a simple missing semicolon can prevent the code from compiling.

6. **Next steps**:
   - Assuming the syntax errors were the only issues (as no other errors were reported by the compiler), the next step would be to compile and run the code to check for runtime errors or logical issues.
   - If further issues arise, a similar detailed analysis will be necessary, focusing on the error logs provided by those specific stages of the development process.

By addressing these errors, the code should now be free from the compilation issues and ready for further testing and validation in the HLS synthesis process.
