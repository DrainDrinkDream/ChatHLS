**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Error Analysis:**
   - The first compiler error points to a syntax issue with the line containing `'LOOP_SHIFT:for (i=0;i<N-1; i++) {`. The error message indicates a missing terminating character and an unexpected expression, hinting that the single quote `'` before `LOOP_SHIFT` is likely a typo.
   - Another set of errors revolves around `LOOP_ACCUM:for (j=0;j<N-1; j++) {`, with the compiler unable to interpret `LOOP_ACCUM:` as a valid syntax for C/C++, indicating issues with label formatting or placement.

2. **Debugging the Label Syntax Errors:**
   - **Error**: The single quote `'` preceding `LOOP_SHIFT:for (i=0;i<N-1; i++) {` is causing a syntax error, preventing the compiler from correctly parsing the loop label.
   - **Fix**: Remove the single quote `'` to correct the syntax. The line should read `LOOP_SHIFT:for (i=0;i<N-1; i++) {`.
   - **Reflection**: After this fix, the loop label should be correctly recognized by the compiler, resolving the initial syntax errors.

3. **Addressing Further Syntax and Declaration Errors:**
   - **Error**: Compilation errors associated with `LOOP_ACCUM:for (j=0;j<N-1; j++) {` suggest that the compiler is not recognizing `LOOP_ACCUM:` as a valid label followed by a loop.
   - **Fix**: Ensure no additional syntax errors or spacing issues are present around the loop label `LOOP_ACCUM:`.
   - **Reflection**: This fix should ensure that the loop is properly recognized as labeled, allowing the code inside the loop to compile correctly.

4. **Final Compilation Check:**
   - After making the above changes, recheck the entire code for any other syntactic or logical errors that might prevent successful compilation.
   - **Reflection**: If there are no further errors reported, the code should now be compatible with HLS constraints and ready for further synthesis and testing phases.

5. **Summarize and Plan Next Steps:**
   - With the syntax errors corrected, it is important to test the function to ensure it behaves as expected in runtime simulations and during synthesis.
   - If the function passes all tests, the next steps would involve integrating it into the larger project and performing comprehensive system-level testing.

By addressing each error sequentially as laid out above, we ensure a methodical approach to debugging that systematically eliminates compiler errors and enhances code stability for HLS environments.
