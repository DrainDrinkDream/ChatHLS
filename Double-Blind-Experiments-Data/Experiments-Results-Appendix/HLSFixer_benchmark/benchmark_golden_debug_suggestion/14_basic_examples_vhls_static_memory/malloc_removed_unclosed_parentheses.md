**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Analysis**:
   Starting with the compiler error log, the first error indicates:
   ```text
   "../../../../malloc_removed.c:20:4: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('dsel_t' (aka 'int') and 'int *')"
   ```
   This error points to line 20 in our code. Upon inspection, the line is:
   ```cpp
   if (i<width *(array_local+i)=din[i];
   ```
   The error message suggests an issue with the operands used in an expression, likely due to missing parentheses which causes the conditional and assignment to blend incorrectly.

2. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   The likely cause is a syntax error due to missing parentheses. Without closing parentheses after the condition `i<width`, the compiler misinterprets the subsequent expression, leading to an invalid operation.

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   To confirm this hypothesis, I compared the structure of the conditional statement with typical C/C++ syntax norms and found that indeed the parentheses should enclose the condition for clarity and correctness.

4. **Error Correction Proposal**:
   Modify the line as follows:
   ```cpp
   if (i<width) 
       *(array_local+i)=din[i];
   ```
   This closes the parentheses properly and separates the conditional check from the assignment statement. 

5. **Reflect and Next Steps**:
   After fixing the first error, I proceed to address the next error in the log:
   ```text
   "../../../../malloc_removed.c:21:3: error: expected expression"
   ```
   This is pointing to the `else` statement. Given the previous error was due to a syntax mistake, itâ€™s probable that this error was also indirectly caused by the same issue, as the compiler couldn't recognize the `else` due to the malformed `if` statement.

6. **Further Investigation & Resolution**:
   With the `if` statement corrected, the `else` should now be correctly recognized by the compiler as part of the conditional structure. Thus, no additional modification is required for the `else` statement once the `if` is fixed.

7. **Final Reflection**:
   With these corrections, the syntax of the conditional statements should now be correct, and the code should compile without the reported errors. The logical flow appears consistent with the expected behavior, which is to conditionally shift values in an array and accumulate them. The next step would be to recompile and check for further errors or warnings, ensuring the functionality matches the intended design, especially under the `NO_SYNTH` conditions where dynamic memory is used.
