**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the error based on error log:**
   - The error log states: "undefined reference to `computeResult`". This implies that the function `computeResult` is being called but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This is a linker error indicating the absence of the definition or declaration of `computeResult`.

2. **Analyzing why the error occurred:**
   - Given the error log, it is evident that the function `computeResult` is expected to process some value and return a result. The call to this function is present in the line `return computeResult(*out_accum);` in the `malloc_removed` function. However, because there is no definition or mention of `computeResult` in the surrounding code or included headers, the compiler fails to link the function call, resulting in the error.

3. **Proposing a fix:**
   - To resolve this error, consider two possibilities:
     a. If `computeResult` is meant to perform a specific operation not detailed here, it should be defined or correctly declared and defined in another file or part of the project that should be properly linked.
     b. If `computeResult` was mistakenly written or the intended operation was simply to return the `*out_accum`, replacing `computeResult(*out_accum)` with `*out_accum` would rectify the error.

4. **Applying the proposed fix:**
   - For the scope of this debugging task and based on the provided compiler error log, let's assume the correct operation is to return the value pointed to by `out_accum`. Therefore, I will replace `return computeResult(*out_accum);` with `return *out_accum;`.

5. **Reflection and verification:**
   - After replacing the erroneous function call with a direct return statement, recompiling the code should ideally not produce the previous linker error regarding `computeResult`. This fix aligns with the error log provided and should resolve the compilation issue reported. 

6. **Plan next steps:**
   - Once the compilation succeeds, it will be essential to verify through simulation or runtime checks whether the function operates as expected logically. Any logical errors would require a separate analysis and debugging cycle focusing on the functionality and expected outputs of the corrected code.

```cpp
return *out_accum; // Replacing computeResult call with direct value return
```
