**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Step 1: Analyzing Compiler Error Log**
   - The first error in the log points to the use of `malloc` in lines 10 and 11: "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'malloc_removed': Undefined function malloc (malloc_removed.c:10:37)" and the similar error for line 11. This suggests that `malloc` may not be synthesizable or correctly recognized in the context of HLS.
   - A warning about potential out of bounds access at line 24 suggests there might be issues with how arrays are being accessed or sized.

2. **Step 2: Hypothesis Formation**
   - Given the error messages, it's likely that dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` is either not supported or not advisable in HLS environments because HLS environments prefer fixed-size, statically allocated memory for predictability and efficiency in hardware.
   - The out-of-bounds warning could mean that the loop might be attempting access beyond the allocated memory, or there is a lack of protection against such access.

3. **Step 3: Testing and Verification**
   - Examining the loop `LOOP_SHIFT` and `LOOP_ACCUM`, notice they both run from `0` to `N-1`. If `N` is exactly the size of `din` and `array_local`, this should be fine, but if `N` is larger or if there's any indexing error, it could lead to out-of-bounds access.
   - To address the `malloc` issue, consider replacing dynamic allocation with static allocation. This would involve declaring arrays with a fixed size at compile-time, rather than allocating them at runtime.

4. **Step 4: Proposing Fixes**
   - Replace dynamic memory allocation with static allocation:
     ```cpp
     #ifdef NO_SYNTH
       long long _out_accum;  // Static allocation for accumulator
       long long *out_accum = &_out_accum;
       int _array_local[64];  // Static allocation for local array
       int* array_local = _array_local;
     #else
       long long _out_accum;
       long long *out_accum = &_out_accum;
       int _array_local[64];
       int* array_local = _array_local;
     #endif
     ```
   - This change avoids the use of `malloc` and initializes pointers to statically allocated memory. This adjustment should handle the HLS synthesis errors related to memory allocation.

5. **Step 5: Reflection and Further Steps**
   - After implementing the above changes, the next step would be to recompile the code with the HLS toolchain to confirm the resolution of the previous errors and check for new issues.
   - Review the loop boundaries and logic once more to ensure no further out-of-bounds access could occur, especially since the static allocation size for `_array_local` is fixed at 64.

By replacing dynamic memory allocation with static allocation and ensuring array accesses are within bounds, the code should be more compatible with HLS requirements, leading to successful synthesis.
