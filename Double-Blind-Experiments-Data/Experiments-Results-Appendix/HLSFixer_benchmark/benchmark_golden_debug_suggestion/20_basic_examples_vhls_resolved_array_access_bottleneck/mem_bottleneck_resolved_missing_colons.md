**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Review and Error Log Analysis:**
   - I started by examining the error log provided by the Vitis HLS Compiler. The error log explicitly states that there's a syntax error, specifically a missing semicolon `;` before the `}` token in the loop within the function `mem_bottleneck_resolved`. The exact error line pointed out is `tmp1 = tmp2`, indicating that the line is missing a semicolon at the end.

2. **Identifying the Error in Code:**
   - With the error log's guidance, I reviewed the buggy code and confirmed that the line `tmp1 = tmp2` indeed lacks a semicolon at its end. This syntax error would prevent the code from compiling, which aligns with the "Compilation error" noted in the C-SIM Failure Details.

3. **Proposed Fix:**
   - To resolve this syntax error, I need to add a semicolon at the end of the line `tmp1 = tmp2;`. This change will adhere to proper C/C++ syntax rules and should allow the code to compile successfully.

4. **Reflection and Next Steps:**
   - After addressing the missing semicolon, the next logical step is to recompile the code to ensure that this was the only issue preventing successful compilation. Assuming no further syntax errors are present, the next stages of simulation and synthesis (C-SIM, C-SYNTH, and Co-SIM) can then be tested to ensure functional and timing correctness.

5. **Testing and Verification:**
   - It's essential to compile and run the corrected code in the Vitis HLS environment to confirm that the fix resolves the issue without introducing new ones. This test will validate the hypothesis that the missing semicolon was the sole cause of the compilation failure.

6. **Final Reflection:**
   - If the code compiles and passes subsequent simulation and synthesis stages without further issues, the fix can be considered successful. It is always good practice to review and ensure that similar syntactic mistakes are not present elsewhere in the codebase to prevent future errors. 

By following these steps, the identified error is addressed, and the code should be on its way to successful deployment in an HLS context.
