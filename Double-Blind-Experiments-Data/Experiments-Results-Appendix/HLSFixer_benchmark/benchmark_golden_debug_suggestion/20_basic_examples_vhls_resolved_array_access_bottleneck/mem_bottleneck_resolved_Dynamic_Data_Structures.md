Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Error Identification**: The first step involves examining the compiler error log. The log mentions issues related to the use of dynamic memory allocation functions (`new[]` and `delete[]`). This is indicated by the messages:
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'mem_bottleneck_resolved(ap_int<7>*)': Undefined function operator new[] (mem_bottleneck_resolved.cpp:8:16)"
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'mem_bottleneck_resolved(ap_int<7>*)': Undefined function operator delete[] (mem_bottleneck_resolved.cpp:20:3)"
   The errors are explicitly pointing to the lines where `new[]` and `delete[]` are used.

2. **Analysis of Dynamic Memory Usage**: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools, like Vitis HLS, often do not support dynamic memory allocation because it can lead to unpredictable behavior in the synthesized hardware, which requires predetermined memory usage patterns and sizes. Therefore, any use of `new[]` or `delete[]` is typically incompatible with HLS.

3. **Identifying the Purpose of the Dynamic Memory**: The creation of the dynamic array `mem_1` in the buggy code does not appear to serve any functional purpose in the computation of `sum`. It seems to be an artifact that might have been used for debugging or mistakenly left in the code. This array does not interact with any other part of the code, and there are no operations performed on it.

4. **Proposed Fix**: 
   - **Remove the dynamic memory allocation**: The lines involving `new[]` and `delete[]` should be completely removed from the code. This includes:
     ```cpp
     int* mem_1 = new int[N];
     ```
     and 
     ```cpp
     delete[] mem_1;
     ```
   Removing these lines should not affect the functionality of the function but will make the code HLS-compatible.

5. **Reflection and Next Steps**: After removing the dynamic memory allocation, the function should closely mirror the functionality described in the error-free original code. The next step would be to re-run the HLS synthesis process to ensure that there are no further errors and that the function now complies with the HLS requirements. This process would validate that the removal of the erroneous lines resolves the synthesis issues without introducing new problems.

By following these steps, the HLS compatibility issues stemming from dynamic memory usage can be resolved, making the function suitable for hardware synthesis.
