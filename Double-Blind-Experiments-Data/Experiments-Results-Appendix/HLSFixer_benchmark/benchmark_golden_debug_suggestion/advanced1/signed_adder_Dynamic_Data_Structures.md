The HLS compiler error log provides specific errors that need to be addressed in the buggy code. Here's the analysis and the proposed fixes:

**Identified Errors and Analysis:**

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation with `new` and `delete`**:
   - **Error Messages**:
     - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'signed_adder(ap_int<8>, ap_int<8>, ap_int<8>*, bool*)': Undefined function operator new (signed_adder.cpp:5:27)"
     - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'signed_adder(ap_int<8>, ap_int<8>, ap_int<8>*, bool*)': Undefined function operator delete (signed_adder.cpp:20:5)"
   - **Reason**: HLS does not support dynamic memory allocation as it introduces uncertainty in memory management, which is incompatible with the deterministic nature required for hardware synthesis. The use of `new` and `delete` for creating a dynamic variable `dynamic_sum` is inappropriate for an HLS environment.
   - **Proposed Fix**: Remove the dynamic memory allocation and directly compute the sum using the provided pointers. Assign the result directly to `*s` and remove `dynamic_sum`.

**Proposed Code Modification**:
```cpp
void signed_adder(din_t a, din_t b, dout_t* s, overflow_t* overflow) {
    // Directly compute the sum into the provided pointer for sum
    *s = a + b;

    // Extract the sign bits
    bool a_sign = a[7];
    bool b_sign = b[7];
    bool s_sign = (*s)[7];

    // Compute overflow: occurs when the sign of a and b are the same but the sign of the sum is different
    *overflow = ( (a_sign == b_sign) && (s_sign != a_sign) );
}
```

**Chain of Thought (CoT)**:
- **Error Identification**: First, I examined the error log which highlighted issues with `operator new` and `operator delete`. This directly pointed out the use of dynamic memory allocation.
- **Reasoning**: Knowing that HLS environments require all memory sizes and operations to be determinable at compile time for proper synthesis into hardware, I identified that dynamic memory is unsuitable. The error log confirmed that `new` and `delete` are not defined in this context.
- **Solution Development**: To resolve this, I proposed removing the dynamic memory allocation and modifying the sum calculation to directly use the pointers given in the function parameters. This approach aligns with the requirements of deterministic memory usage in HLS.
- **Reflection and Forward Planning**: After adjusting the memory allocation strategy, I rechecked the remaining code for any other potential HLS incompatibilities but found no further issues. This focused adjustment should resolve the synthesis errors and allow successful hardware implementation.
