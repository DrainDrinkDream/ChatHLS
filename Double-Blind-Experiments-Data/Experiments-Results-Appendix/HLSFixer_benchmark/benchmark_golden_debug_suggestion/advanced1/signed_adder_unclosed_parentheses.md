**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Investigating Compiler Error:**
   - **Step 1: Review Compiler Error Log:**
     The error log provided by the Vitis HLS compiler points out a syntax error in the `signed_adder` function. Specifically, it mentions an expected ‘)’ before ‘;’ token at line 14 in the `signed_adder.cpp` file. This suggests a parentheses mismatch issue in the code.

   - **Step 2: Analyze the Reported Line:**
     Looking at the specific line reported (`*overflow = ( (a_sign == b_sign) && s_sign != a_sign;`), I notice that there is an unclosed parenthesis. The line starts with two open parentheses `((` but only has one corresponding closing parenthesis before the semicolon.

2. **Hypothesizing the Syntax Error:**
   - **Hypothesis:**
     The error is likely due to missing a closing parenthesis to properly complete the logical expression for the overflow condition.

3. **Testing the Hypothesis:**
   - **Step 3: Verify the Syntax:**
     To resolve the syntax error, I will add a closing parenthesis at the end of the expression before the semicolon. This should correctly close the logical expression and match the number of opening and closing parentheses.

   - **Proposed Fix:**
     Change the line from:
     ```cpp
     *overflow = ( (a_sign == b_sign) && s_sign != a_sign;
     ```
     to:
     ```cpp
     *overflow = ( (a_sign == b_sign) && (s_sign != a_sign) );
     ```

4. **Reflection and Next Steps:**
   - **Step 4: Reflect on the Fix:**
     Adding the missing parenthesis should address the syntax error reported by the compiler. Once this syntax issue is resolved, the compiler should be able to proceed further in compiling the code, possibly revealing any further logical or runtime issues not currently visible due to the blocking syntax error.

   - **Step 5: Plan for Further Testing:**
     After applying the fix, the next step would be to recompile the code using the Vitis HLS compiler to ensure that this syntax error is resolved and no new errors are introduced. Subsequent testing should include functional simulation to verify that the logic for calculating overflow works as expected.

By following these detailed steps and focusing on the specific error reported by the compiler, the debugging process addresses the immediate issue and prepares the code for further testing and validation.
