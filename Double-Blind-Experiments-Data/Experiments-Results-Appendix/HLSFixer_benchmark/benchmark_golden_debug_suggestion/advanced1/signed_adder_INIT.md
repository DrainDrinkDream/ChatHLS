Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Error Identification**:
   - The HLS compiler error log points out a syntax error at line 11, specifically indicating "expected ',' or ';' before 'bool'". This error is due to the missing semicolons at the end of the lines where boolean variables `a_sign`, `b_sign`, and `s_sign` are defined.

2. **Analyzing Reasons**:
   - In C++, every statement must end with a semicolon (`;`). The missing semicolons in the declarations of `a_sign`, `b_sign`, and `s_sign` are syntactic errors that prevent the compiler from parsing further, causing it to halt and throw an error.

3. **Propose Fixes**:
   - Add semicolons at the end of the lines where `a_sign`, `b_sign`, and `s_sign` are defined. This will correct the syntax and allow the compiler to successfully parse these statements.

4. **Further Analysis**:
   - After fixing the syntax errors, I revisited the code to ensure that there are no other syntactic or logical errors. The error log specifically targets only the missing semicolons, not indicating any other issues at this stage.

5. **Reflection and Next Steps**:
   - Fixing the semicolons should resolve the compilation errors highlighted in the log. However, the logic and functionality of the code should also be verified against the expected behavior of the function (which is to calculate the sum of two signed integers and determine if there's an overflow). 
   - I would then compile the code again to check if there are any further errors or warnings that need to be addressed.

Proposed Code Correction:
```cpp
#include "signed_adder.h"

void signed_adder(din_t a, din_t b, dout_t* s, overflow_t* overflow) {
    *s = a + b;

    bool a_sign = a[7];
    bool b_sign = b[7];
    bool s_sign = (*s)[7];

    *overflow = ((a_sign == b_sign) && (s_sign != a_sign));
}
```

This debugging process addressed the immediate errors preventing compilation as identified by the HLS compiler error log.
