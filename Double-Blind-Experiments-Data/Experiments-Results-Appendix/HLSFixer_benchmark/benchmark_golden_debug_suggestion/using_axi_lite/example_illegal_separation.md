Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Inspection and Error Identification**
   The compiler error log indicates that there are syntax errors in the code. Specifically, the errors mention the absence of a ';' at the end of the line `*c += *a + *b` and the absence of a closing '}' for the function `example`.

2. **Analyzing the Compiler Error Log**
   - The error `'../../../../example.cpp:9:18: error: expected ‘;’ at end of input'` clearly points out that the compiler expected a semicolon at the end of the line where the arithmetic operation is performed. In C/C++, every statement should end with a semicolon to indicate the end of that statement.
   - The subsequent error `'../../../../example.cpp:9:17: error: expected ‘}’ at end of input'` suggests that the function is not correctly terminated with a closing brace '}'. Every function block in C/C++ should start with an opening '{' and end with a closing '}' to encapsulate the function’s scope.

3. **Hypothesis Formation**
   Based on the error messages, the hypothesis is:
   - The missing semicolon is causing the compiler to not recognize the end of the expression statement.
   - The missing closing brace '}' is causing the compiler to not recognize the end of the function, thereby throwing an error expecting '}' at the end.

4. **Proposing Fixes**
   To resolve these issues:
   - Add a semicolon at the end of line 9 after `*c += *a + *b;` to properly terminate the statement.
   - Add a closing brace '}' at the end of the function to define the function's scope correctly.

5. **Reflection and Verification**
   These fixes should address the compilation errors as they directly correlate with the errors pointed out in the compiler error log. The absence of these syntax elements (semicolon and closing brace) is a common mistake and typically results in such compiler errors. After making these changes, the code should compile successfully under normal circumstances and also align with typical C/C++ syntax rules. 

6. **Next Steps**
   After applying these fixes, recompile the code to ensure that these changes resolve the compilation errors. If any further errors occur, analyze the new error messages and iterate on the debugging process.
