Starting with the error log provided by the Vitis HLS compiler, the most immediate issue flagged is an error related to a comment syntax. This points us directly to an examination of the comments in the code. The error message specifically states: "...error: expected unqualified-id before ‘/’ token / This is an illegal comment ^". This implies that the compiler encounters an issue right at the start of the line containing the comment.

Upon inspecting the provided buggy code, the line with the comment is "/ This is an illegal comment". The most noticeable issue here is that the comment syntax in C/C++ starts with "//", but in this line, it is initiated with a single "/". This mistake would prevent the compiler from recognizing this line as a comment, instead trying to interpret it as code, resulting in a syntax error.

The solution to this issue is straightforward: correct the comment syntax by adding an additional "/". Therefore, the buggy line:
"/ This is an illegal comment"
should be corrected to:
"// This is an illegal comment".

This modification will allow the compiler to correctly recognize and ignore this line as a comment, adhering to the standard C/C++ syntax rules. After this change, the compiler should no longer throw the mentioned syntax error, and the code should proceed further in the compilation process.

Reflecting on this process, the primary error was a simple syntax oversight that could be easily corrected by adhering to standard programming conventions for comments in C/C++. Moving forward, it will be essential to ensure that other syntactical rules are followed throughout the code to prevent similar compilation issues.
