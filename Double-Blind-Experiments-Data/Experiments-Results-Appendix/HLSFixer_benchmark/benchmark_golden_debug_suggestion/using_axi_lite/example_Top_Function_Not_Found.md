**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Observation and Compiler Error Identification:**
   - The compiler error log indicates an error named "Top_Function_Not_Found" during the linking phase when trying to reference a function `example(char*, char*, char*)` from a testbench file `example_test.cpp`.
   - This error suggests that the function named `example` expected by the testbench does not exist or is incorrectly named in the provided source file.

2. **Error Analysis:**
   - Upon examining the buggy code, the defined function is `example_top(char* a, char* b, char* c)` whereas the testbench in the error log is looking for `example(char*, char*, char*)`.
   - This mismatch in function names is a clear cause of the linker error as the names must match exactly for the linker to correctly resolve references during compilation.

3. **Proposing a Fix:**
   - To resolve this issue, the function name in the buggy code should be corrected to match the one expected by the testbench.
   - Change the function name from `example_top` to `example` in the buggy code.

4. **Detailed Correction Step:**
   - Modify the function declaration from:
     ```cpp
     void example_top(char* a, char* b, char* c) {
     ```
     to
     ```cpp
     void example(char* a, char* b, char* c) {
     ```

5. **Reflection and Verification:**
   - This name correction should resolve the linker error as now the function `example(char*, char*, char*)` referenced in the `example_test.cpp` exists with the correct name in the source code.
   - After making this change, recompiling should proceed without the 'undefined reference' error, assuming no other discrepancies in parameters or function usage.

6. **Final Steps:**
   - After the function name correction, ensure all interface pragmas and operational logic within the function remain consistent and correct. This is validated by the fact that no other errors were mentioned in the error log related to functionality or pragmas.
   - Compile and run the testbench again to ensure that the error is resolved and the functionality meets the expected behavior as per the test case specifications.

By following these detailed steps, the linkage error reported by the Vitis HLS compiler should be resolved, aligning the function definitions between the source and test files, and ensuring successful compilation and linkage.
