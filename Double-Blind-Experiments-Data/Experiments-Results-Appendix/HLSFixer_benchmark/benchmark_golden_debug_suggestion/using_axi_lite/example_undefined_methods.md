Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Review of the Compiler Error Log**:
   The compiler log clearly indicates a compilation error stemming from the use of an undefined function. The specific error message from the log states: `'undefinedFunctionâ€™ was not declared in this scope`. This error is generated from the `example.cpp` file on line 10, where the function call `undefinedFunction();` is made.

2. **Analysis of the Error**:
   Given the error message, the most straightforward issue is that the function `undefinedFunction()` is indeed not declared or defined anywhere in the given code snippet. In C/C++, a function must be declared or defined before it is used, unless it's a built-in function of the language/compiler, which in this case, it is not.

3. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   The presence of this function call which leads to a compilation error suggests either the function was meant to be defined elsewhere and mistakenly not included, or it was added erroneously. Since this function call interrupts the compilation process, it must be addressed to enable successful compilation and further synthesis processes.

4. **Testing the Hypothesis**:
   By removing the line containing `undefinedFunction();`, we can test if this resolves the compilation error. If the error relating to this function call disappears after its removal, it supports the hypothesis that the function was indeed not meant to be there or was erroneously included.

5. **Proposed Fix**:
   Based on the hypothesis and the straightforward nature of the error, the fix involves removing the line `undefinedFunction();` from the code. This aligns the buggy code with typical C/C++ practices where only defined or declared functions should be called.

6. **Reflection**:
   The removal of the erroneous function call should resolve the immediate compilation error as indicated by the compiler log. This change would allow the compiler to proceed with further steps in the compilation and synthesis processes. The next steps would involve re-compiling the code to confirm that the error was indeed fixed and that no other issues are present. 

7. **Plan Next Steps**:
   After applying the fix, the re-compilation and simulation would be necessary to ensure that the function `example` operates as expected, performing the operation `*c += *a + *b;` without issues. This would validate not only the removal of the erroneous function but also the functional correctness of the remaining code.

This systematic analysis and the proposed fix should address the identified compilation issue, allowing the HLS tool to effectively simulate and synthesize the `example` function without further interruptions.
