Chain of Thought (CoT):
```text
1. Initial Assessment:
   - I first examined the provided error log which indicates a compilation error in the file `example.cpp` at line 9. The error specifically points to an expected ')' before ';'. This suggests a syntax error related to parentheses management.

2. Syntax Error Investigation:
   - Upon inspecting line 9 in the buggy code: `*c += (*a + *b;`, I observed that there is an opening parenthesis after `+=` which is not closed before the semicolon. This aligns with the error message from the log, indicating a missing closing parenthesis.

3. Hypothesis Formation:
   - I hypothesized that the correct operation intended here was to perform the addition of the values pointed to by `a` and `b`, and then add this result to the value pointed to by `c`. The error in the code is likely a typographical one where the closing parenthesis was accidentally omitted.

4. Testing and Verification:
   - To test this hypothesis, I checked the structure of similar arithmetic operations and their typical syntax in C/C++. It's clear that every opening parenthesis should have a corresponding closing parenthesis to complete the operation syntax properly.

5. Reflection and Correction Proposal:
   - Based on the analysis and standard syntax rules, the fix is straightforward. I need to add a closing parenthesis at the end of the operation before the semicolon.
   - Corrected line: `*c += (*a + *b);`

6. Conclusion:
   - The error was purely syntactical due to a missing parenthesis. After adding the missing parenthesis, the line should compile without errors, thus resolving the compilation issue indicated in the error log.

By systematically breaking down the error log, examining the associated code, and applying knowledge of C/C++ syntax, I could identify and propose a fix for the bug in the HLS code.
