Chain of Thought (CoT):
```text
1. **Identify Errors:**
   - The error log indicates a runtime error with a segmentation fault (`SIGSEGV`). This typically occurs due to invalid memory access.

2. **Analyze Reasons:**
   - In the buggy code, the line `char* temp;` declares a pointer `temp` without initializing it. The subsequent line `*temp = *a + *b;` attempts to dereference and write to this uninitialized pointer, leading to undefined behavior and likely causing the segmentation fault.

3. **Propose Fixes:**
   - To resolve this issue, remove the unnecessary use of `temp` and directly perform the addition and assignment. Modify the code to: `*c = *a + *b;`

4. **Sequential Reasoning:**
   - Start by addressing the immediate cause of the segmentation fault. The uninitialized pointer `temp` is the source of the runtime error. Directly using `*c` avoids the undefined behavior.

5. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   - Given the error log and the code, the hypothesis is that the root cause of the crash is the dereferencing of an uninitialized pointer `temp`. 

6. **Testing and Verification:**
   - By removing the temporary pointer and directly performing operations on `*c`, the hypothesis can be tested. This change aligns with the correct handling of pointers and memory access.

7. **Reflection:**
   - After making the change, the expectation is that the segmentation fault should no longer occur during simulation. This reflects a proper understanding of pointer initialization and usage in C/C++ programming for HLS.
