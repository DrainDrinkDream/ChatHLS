**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Observation and Error Identification:**
   - Upon examining the error log, the most evident error noted is at line 8 of `mux.cpp`, where the compiler expected a `)` before the `{` token.
   - The log specifically points out: `../../../../mux.cpp:8:17: error: expected ‘)’ before ‘{’ token`
   - This indicates a syntax error in the `if` statement condition, suggesting the closing parenthesis `)` is missing.

2. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   - Based on the error message, I hypothesize that not closing the parenthesis in the `if` condition is causing the compiler to fail in correctly parsing the subsequent block of code.
   - This type of error typically leads to further downstream errors as the compiler struggles to interpret the start and end of code blocks correctly.

3. **Code Examination and Verification:**
   - By examining the specific line in the buggy code: `if (sel == 0 {`, it's clear that the closing parenthesis `)` after `0` is missing.
   - Correcting this should resolve the syntax error and allow the compiler to correctly parse the following code blocks.

4. **Proposed Fix:**
   - Modify the line from: `if (sel == 0 {` to `if (sel == 0) {`.
   - This change adheres strictly to the C/C++ syntax rules for conditional statements.

5. **Reflection on Findings and Next Steps:**
   - After fixing the missing parenthesis, it's essential to recompile the code to ensure that this correction resolves the initial error without introducing new ones.
   - Assuming this was the primary issue, the subsequent error highlighted in the log (`error: expected primary-expression before ‘}’ token`) should also be resolved as it likely stemmed from the initial parsing issue.
   - If there are no further errors, the code should now compile successfully, and the functionality should be as expected.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Syntax errors such as missing parentheses are common and can disrupt the overall structure of the code, leading to further compilation errors.
   - Careful reading of compiler error logs is crucial in pinpointing the exact location and nature of syntax errors.
   - Addressing these errors systematically and verifying through recompilation ensures robust code correction and functionality assurance.
