Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Analysis of Error Log**:
   The compiler error log points specifically to a syntax error: `'letâ€™ was not declared in this scope`. This error is located at line 13 of `mux.cpp`. This is our starting point as it is a clear and direct indication of an issue in the code.

2. **Identification and Hypothesis**:
   Upon examining the line in question - `let result = *out;`, it's evident that `let` is not a recognized keyword or type in standard C++. This suggests it might be a typo or a misunderstanding of C++ syntax. My hypothesis is that the programmer might have confused `let`, possibly influenced by other programming languages with similar syntax (like JavaScript or Swift), with a valid C++ declaration.

3. **Verification of Hypothesis**:
   To test the hypothesis, I will compare this part of the code with typical C++ syntax. In C++, variable declaration is done with a type specified explicitly, like `int`, `char`, `float`, etc., followed by the variable name and optionally initialization. The usage of `let` doesn't fit this model, and thus is likely incorrect. Removing or correcting it should address the syntax error.

4. **Proposed Fix**:
   As the line `let result = *out;` does not contribute to the functionality described (which is to assign `a` or `b` to `*out` based on `sel`), the simplest solution is to remove this line. This aligns with the requirement that the function performs a specific operation based on the value of `sel` without any further processing or storing of results.

5. **Reflection and Conclusion**:
   After removing the erroneous line, the function should compile correctly and perform as expected, simply assigning the value based on `sel`. This fix not only resolves the compiler error but also ensures that the function's operation is clear and direct, which is preferable in embedded or hardware-related programming to avoid unnecessary complexity and potential side effects.

Thus, the debugging process leads to the conclusion that removing the line `let result = *out;` will correct the error and align the code with expected functionality. This step-wise approach, starting from a direct compiler error and using logical analysis to propose a fix, ensures that the resolution is accurate and justified based on the error log and language syntax.
