**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Error Analysis**:
   - The error log indicates issues with the use of dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete`). Specifically, errors are:
     - "Undefined function operator new"
     - "Undefined function operator delete"
   - These errors suggest that dynamic memory allocation is not supported or is problematic for the Vitis HLS environment.

2. **Reasoning Behind Dynamic Memory Allocation Errors**:
   - HLS tools typically require that the memory footprint be predictable and efficiently managed. Dynamic memory allocation introduces uncertainties in memory usage and can lead to non-deterministic behaviors, which are undesirable in hardware synthesis contexts.
   - By checking the error messages, it's clear that the HLS toolchain does not recognize the `new` and `delete` operations, likely because these operations do not have direct hardware equivalents or lead to inefficiencies in synthesized hardware.

3. **Hypothesizing the Fix**:
   - Based on the errors and general HLS restrictions, the use of dynamic memory should be removed. Instead, direct operations on the outputs and inputs should be carried out, as typically seen in HLS-friendly code.

4. **Proposed Code Modification**:
   - Remove the lines involving `new` and `delete`:
     ```cpp
     data_t* dynamic_data = new data_t; 
     ...
     delete dynamic_data;
     ```
   - Modify the function to directly assign values to `*out` based on the condition:
     ```cpp
     if (sel == 0) {
         *out = a;
     } else {
         *out = b;
     }
     ```
   - This modification directly reflects the original code's structure and removes the unnecessary complexity introduced by dynamic memory allocation.

5. **Reflecting on the Fix**:
   - By simplifying the code and aligning it more closely with typical HLS practices (avoiding dynamic memory allocation), we ensure that the function is more predictable and suitable for hardware synthesis.
   - The fix should address the synthesis errors by eliminating the unrecognized operations (`new` and `delete`) and should make the function directly translate to hardware logic.

6. **Final Thoughts**:
   - Always aim for simplicity and predictability in HLS code. Avoid features that are primarily designed for general-purpose computing, like dynamic memory allocation, unless absolutely necessary and supported by the HLS toolchain.
   - Regularly check the HLS tool documentation for best practices and supported C/C++ features to prevent similar issues.

By adhering to these steps and insights, the modified code should successfully pass the Vitis HLS synthesis without the previous errors and be better aligned for hardware implementation.
