Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Error Identification**: The error log from the HLS compiler indicates a primary issue related to a comment in the code. Specifically, the compiler error states:
   - "error: expected primary-expression before ‘/’ token"
   - "error: ‘Change’ was not declared in this scope"
   These errors suggest that there is likely a syntax issue around the location where these errors are reported.

2. **Analyzing the Code Location**: The error log points to the line:
   ```cpp
   / Change state if 'in' is low (false) 
   ```
   This line was intended to be a comment but is missing an additional forward slash (`//`) at the beginning. The absence of the correct comment syntax (`//`) causes the compiler to interpret it as code, leading to the aforementioned errors.

3. **Proposed Fix**: To resolve this, the line should be corrected to:
   ```cpp
   // Change state if 'in' is low (false) 
   ```
   Adding the second slash will correctly designate the line as a comment, preventing the compiler from trying to interpret it as executable code.

4. **Reflecting on the Fix**: Adding the correct comment syntax will likely resolve the immediate compilation error. Since this was the only error highlighted by the compiler in the error log, fixing it should allow the code to compile correctly.

5. **Next Steps**: After applying the proposed fix, the next logical step would be to recompile the code to confirm that no further errors exist. If other issues are observed in further testing phases (like simulation or synthesis), those would need to be addressed separately. However, based on the provided error log, correcting the comment should resolve the current issue.

This sequential reasoning leads us to conclude that the syntax error related to improper commenting is the root cause of the compilation failure, and correcting it should allow the HLS tool to process the code further.
