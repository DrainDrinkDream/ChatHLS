Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Identifying the Error**: By examining the Vitis HLS Compiler Error Log, the first issue identified is related to the use of dynamic memory allocation:
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'cpp_ap_int_arith': Undefined function operator new[] (cpp_ap_int_arith.cpp:6:23)"
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'cpp_ap_int_arith': Undefined function operator delete[] (cpp_ap_int_arith.cpp:13:2)"

2. **Analyzing Reasons**: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools typically do not support dynamic memory allocation because the memory needs to be statically determinable at compile-time for hardware synthesis. The use of `new` and `delete` operators introduces unpredictability and complexity that is not manageable in the context of HLS. This is the reason for the aforementioned errors, as HLS cannot resolve these dynamic memory operations into a fixed hardware structure.

3. **Proposing Fixes**: 
   - To resolve these errors, remove the lines of code that involve dynamic memory allocation. Specifically, remove:
     ```cpp
     int* dynamic_array = new int[10];
     ```
     and
     ```cpp
     delete[] dynamic_array;
     ```
   - This change will eliminate the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, making the code compatible with HLS requirements.

4. **Testing and Verification**: After removing the dynamic memory-related lines, the rest of the code should be re-evaluated to ensure no references to the `dynamic_array` variable remain. Since there were no operations performed on `dynamic_array` in the buggy code, its removal should not affect the functionality of the remaining code.

5. **Reflection**: Removing the dynamic memory allocation aligns the buggy code with the typical constraints of HLS tools, which prefer static memory allocation to determine hardware resource needs at compile-time. This change should allow the HLS tool to synthesize the code without the previous errors related to memory management.

By following this debugging strategy, we address the critical issues highlighted by the HLS compiler, ensuring the code is now suitable for synthesis into hardware without unnecessary complexities introduced by unsupported features like dynamic memory allocation.
