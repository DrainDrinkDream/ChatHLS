Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Error Identification**: The first and foremost error identified from the compiler log points to line 7 in the code, where there is an unclosed string:
   ```cpp
   explanation = "wrong here
   ```
   The compiler error specifically states:
   - `missing terminating " character` which clearly indicates that the string is not closed with a quote.

2. **Reasoning Behind the Error**: This line of code attempts to assign a string to a variable `explanation` which is neither declared nor properly formatted as a string due to the missing closing quote. The missing quote leads to a compilation error because the compiler cannot correctly parse the code, hence failing right at the syntax checking phase.

3. **Proposed Fix for the Error**: Since the line `explanation = "wrong here";` does not contribute to the functionality described in the function signature and is causing a syntax error, the simplest fix is to remove this line altogether. This removal will help in clearing the syntax error and allow the compiler to proceed with further checks and compilation.

   ```cpp
   // Remove the line completely
   ```

4. **Further Analysis and Validation**: After removing the erroneous line, the next step is to recompile the code. Since the description does not provide further details of runtime logic errors or additional compilation errors, and the function seems straightforward in performing arithmetic operations and assigning them to pointers, it's reasonable to conclude that removing the line should resolve the compilation issues.

5. **Reflection and Conclusion**: The error was primarily due to a syntax mistake with an unclosed string and an undeclared variable. Such errors are common and can be easily overlooked during coding. Removing the line fixes the error, and the function should now compile and run as expected, performing the arithmetic operations defined.

By following the steps above, the code should be free from the syntax error and ready for further compilation and execution tests. If no further errors are reported by the compiler, it can be assumed that the function will execute as intended by performing the specified arithmetic operations.
