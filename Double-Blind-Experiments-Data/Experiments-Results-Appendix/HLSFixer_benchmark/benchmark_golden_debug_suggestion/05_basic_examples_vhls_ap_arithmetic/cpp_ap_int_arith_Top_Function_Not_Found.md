**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Analysis of Error Log**:
   The error log prominently shows a `Top_Function_Not_Found` error. More specifically, there's an "undefined reference" to `cpp_ap_int_arith` with certain parameters in a testing file. This suggests that the linker can't find a definition for a function it expected to find, which was likely intended to be the top function in the HLS design. This error points to a mismatch between the function declaration expected by the test bench and the actual function definition provided in the code.

2. **Identifying the Discrepancy**:
   Upon examining the provided buggy code, I noticed the function is named `cpp_ap_int_arith_notfound`. This is a clear mismatch compared to what the error log suggests, where the test bench expects a function named `cpp_ap_int_arith`.

3. **Hypothesizing and Verifying the Fix**:
   Based on the above analysis, a reasonable hypothesis is that the function name in the buggy code is incorrect. To verify this, comparing the function signature in the error log with the one in the buggy code supports this hypothesis: the parameters and return types match, but the name does not.

4. **Proposing a Fix**:
   Change the function name in the buggy code from `cpp_ap_int_arith_notfound` to `cpp_ap_int_arith`. This should resolve the linking error as the function name expected by the test bench would now correctly match the defined function name.

5. **Reflection and Next Steps**:
   After renaming the function, it would be essential to recompile the code to check if the `Top_Function_Not_Found` error is resolved. No other discrepancies or syntax errors are evident in the buggy code snippet provided, so this change is likely sufficient to resolve the compilation errors indicated in the error log.

6. **Finalizing**:
   The fix focuses solely on correcting the function name to match the expected top-level function declaration. This is a critical step in HLS designs where the function names are often used to bind C++ code with specific hardware implementations and test benches.
