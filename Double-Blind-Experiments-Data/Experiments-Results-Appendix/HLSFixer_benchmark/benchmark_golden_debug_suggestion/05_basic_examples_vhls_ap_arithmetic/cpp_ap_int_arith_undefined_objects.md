Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Error Identification**:
   The compiler error log indicates an issue at line 10 in `cpp_ap_int_arith.cpp`, mentioning that `'out5' was not declared in this scope`. This is the primary error that prevents the code from compiling successfully.

2. **Analyzing the Error Log**:
   The specific error message is:
   ```
   '../../../../cpp_ap_int_arith.cpp:10:3: error: ‘out5’ was not declared in this scope
   *out5 = inD % inA;
   ```
   This error tells us that `out5` is being used but has not been declared or defined anywhere in the code provided.

3. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   Since `out5` is not declared but used as if it were meant to store a result similar to `out1`, `out2`, `out3`, and `out4`, it seems likely that it's being incorrectly referenced. This could be a typographical error or a misreference. If `out5` was intended to store the result of `inD % inA`, it might be that the correct variable, as per a standard naming convention or intended design, should be `out4`.

4. **Testing the Hypothesis**:
   Examining other operations and their corresponding output references (`out1`, `out2`, `out3`), it seems consistent that for the fourth operation, the output should indeed reference `out4` and not `out5`. There is no declaration or usage of `out5` anywhere else in the code, supporting the idea that `out5` is likely a mistake.

5. **Propose a Fix**:
   To resolve this error, replace `out5` with `out4` in the line:
   ```cpp
   *out5 = inD % inA;
   ```
   This should be corrected to:
   ```cpp
   *out4 = inD % inA;
   ```

6. **Verification**:
   After making the above correction, the function correctly uses all declared output pointers (`out1`, `out2`, `out3`, `out4`) corresponding to each operation performed. This not only aligns with the typical pattern seen in the function but also resolves the compilation error flagged by the HLS tool.

7. **Reflection**:
   The error was caused by a simple typographical or copy-paste error which led to using an undefined variable `out5`. By checking the consistency of variable usage and examining the error message closely, we could identify and correct the mistake. This fix should allow the code to compile successfully and perform as intended, assuming the rest of the environment and dependencies are set up correctly.
