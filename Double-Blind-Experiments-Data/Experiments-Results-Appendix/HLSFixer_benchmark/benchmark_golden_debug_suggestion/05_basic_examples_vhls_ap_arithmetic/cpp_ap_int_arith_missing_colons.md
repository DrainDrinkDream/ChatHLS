**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Starting Point:**
   The compiler error log indicates a syntax error in the provided C++ code. The error log specifically mentions "`error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token`" and points to the line "`*out4 = inD % inA`". This suggests that there is a missing semicolon at the end of this expression.

2. **Error Identification:**
   By examining the mentioned line in the buggy code:
   ```cpp
   *out4 = inD % inA
   ```
   It's apparent that the semicolon (`;`) that should terminate this statement is indeed missing.

3. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   The absence of a semicolon in C++ code usually leads to a compilation error as observed. Each statement in C++ must end with a semicolon, and missing it can prevent the compiler from understanding where one statement ends and another begins.

4. **Testing and Verification:**
   To confirm the hypothesis, adding a semicolon at the end of the line should resolve the compilation error. This is a common syntax requirement in C++ programming.

5. **Propose Fixes:**
   To correct the error, modify the line in the buggy code from:
   ```cpp
   *out4 = inD % inA
   ```
   to:
   ```cpp
   *out4 = inD % inA;
   ```

6. **Reflection:**
   After adding the semicolon, the code should now compile without syntax errors. This was a straightforward fix, but it's crucial for ensuring that the code can proceed to further compilation stages and ultimately run correctly. The next steps would involve recompiling the code to verify that there are no further syntax errors and then proceeding to runtime tests to ensure the logic of the code performs as expected.

7. **Conclusion:**
   The error was purely syntactical and not related to the logic of the program or the specifics of HLS constraints or optimizations. After fixing this syntax error, the focus would shift to ensuring that the program meets all functional and performance requirements set forth in its design for high-level synthesis.
