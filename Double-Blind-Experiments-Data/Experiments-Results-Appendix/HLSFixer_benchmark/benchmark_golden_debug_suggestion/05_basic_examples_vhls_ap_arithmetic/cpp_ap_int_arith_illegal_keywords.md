Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Error Identification**:
   The Vitis HLS Compiler Error Log points to a specific error in the code located in the `cpp_ap_int_arith` function. The error message indicates:
   ```
   '../../../../cpp_ap_int_arith.cpp:12:5: error: ‘define’ was not declared in this scope
   ```
   This suggests that the compiler does not recognize the keyword `define`, which is being used at line 12 in our code.

2. **Analyzing the Error**:
   The error log also provides a suggestion to replace `define` with `dysize`, which seems to be a misinterpretation by the error handling mechanism, as `dysize` is unrelated in this context. In standard C++, `define` is not a valid keyword for variable declaration or definition; instead, `#define` is used for defining constants and macros, and it should be placed outside the function body.

   In the buggy code, `define illegal_var = 10;` appears to be an attempt to define a variable. The correct syntax in C++ for defining a variable is using the type specifier followed by the variable name and its value.

3. **Proposed Fix**:
   To correct the error, the line:
   ```cpp
   define illegal_var = 10;
   ```
   should be removed or corrected to use a valid C++ syntax for variable definition. Since there is no further use of `illegal_var` in the function, and it's not part of the function arguments or return, the most straightforward fix is to remove this line completely to match the intended function behavior.

4. **Reflection and Verification**:
   After removing the erroneous line, the function should compile without any further errors if there are no other hidden issues. This change focuses on maintaining the functionality described by the function signature and the operations performed on the inputs to produce the outputs.

5. **Final Review**:
   Once the correction is made, the function should be recompiled to ensure that no further errors occur and that the function operates as expected. The compilation and simulation should complete successfully, indicating that the function is now compatible with the requirements of the HLS tool.

By following the above steps, the HLS-incompatible error is resolved by aligning the code with standard C++ syntax and HLS requirements.
