**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identification of Errors from Compiler Log**:
   - The first error reported is: 
     ```
     '../../../../truthtable.cpp:11:20: error: expected primary-expression before ‘+’ token\n', '         *f[output_t+1] = 1;
     ```
     This suggests that there's an issue with the expression `*f[output_t + 1]`. The syntax seems incorrect because `output_t` is a type, not a variable, and thus cannot be used in arithmetic expressions. The correct intention seems to be to assign a value to the pointed location, not to index it with a type.
   
   - The second error is:
     ```
     '../../../../truthtable.cpp:13:15: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token\n', '         *f = 0
     ```
     This indicates a missing semicolon at the end of the statement `*f = 0`.

2. **Analysis and Hypothesis Formation**:
   - For the first error, since `output_t` is a type, the code `*f[output_t + 1]` is syntactically incorrect. The intention in the context appears to be setting the value of `*f` based on certain conditions. The indexing seems unnecessary and incorrect. It appears to be a typo or a confusion in syntax.
   
   - The second error is straightforward, indicating a missing semicolon, which is a common syntax error in C/C++.

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   - To fix the first error, replacing `*f[output_t + 1] = 1;` with `*f = 1;` would correct the issue. This aligns with typical usage where `f` is a pointer to `output_t` and `*f` is used to assign value to the location `f` points to.
   
   - For the second error, simply adding a semicolon at the end of `*f = 0` would suffice.

4. **Reflection**:
   - After making the above changes, the structure of the function would closely resemble typical functions that assign values to pointers based on conditions.
   - The error regarding the misuse of the type `output_t` as an index was critical and could have led to further confusion about the nature of the syntax and semantics of the language.
   - The missing semicolon is a minor syntax error but crucial for the compiler to interpret the end of the statement.

**Proposed Fixes**:
- Replace `*f[output_t+1] = 1;` with `*f = 1;`.
- Add a semicolon at the end of `*f = 0` to make it `*f = 0;`.

This correction should resolve the compilation errors and align the function's behavior with the intended logic of setting `*f` based on the input conditions.
