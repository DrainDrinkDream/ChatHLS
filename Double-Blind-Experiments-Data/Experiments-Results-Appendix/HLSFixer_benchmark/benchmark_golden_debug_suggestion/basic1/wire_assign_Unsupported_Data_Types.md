**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Error Observation**:
   The error log mentions an "undefined reference to `wire_assign(ap_uint<1>, ap_uint<1>*)`." This suggests that the function `wire_assign` being called in `test_wire_assign.cpp` expects arguments of type `ap_uint<1>` and `ap_uint<1>*`, but the provided function definition in `wire_assign.cpp` accepts and works with `ComplexType` and `ComplexType*`.

2. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   It appears that there is a mismatch between the expected function signature in the testing or calling environment (`test_wire_assign.cpp`) and the provided function signature in `wire_assign.cpp`. This discrepancy leads to linkage errors as the linker cannot find a matching function definition for the calls made.

3. **Cross-Referencing with HLS Requirements**:
   HLS tools often have specific requirements for data types and interfaces. The error term "Unsupported_Data_Types" in the error log hints that `ComplexType` might not be supported or incorrectly utilized for the intended HLS operations.

4. **Proposed Code Correction**:
   - Since the expected function signature involves `ap_uint<1>` and `ap_uint<1>*`, the function definition should be updated to match this. This requires modifying the function signature in `wire_assign.cpp` to:
     ```cpp
     void wire_assign(ap_uint<1> in, ap_uint<1>* out) {
         *out = in;
     }
     ```
   - Replace the data type `ComplexType` with `ap_uint<1>` which is likely more compatible with the expected operations in the HLS context, especially if the function is meant to perform simple wire assignments.

5. **Reflection and Further Considerations**:
   - After updating the function signature and parameters, the linkage error should be resolved as the function definition will now match the expected calls in `test_wire_assign.cpp`.
   - It is also crucial to ensure that the rest of the codebase (if exists beyond the provided snippets) is compatible with these changes, especially regarding the data types and function calls.
   - Additional tests and compilation should be conducted to confirm that the changes have resolved the issues without introducing new ones.

6. **Final Verification**:
   - Re-run the HLS compilation and simulation processes to ensure that the changes have correctly addressed the issues outlined in the error log.
   - Confirm that there are no additional errors or unexpected behaviors resulting from the modifications.

By following the above steps, the linkage error and the HLS compatibility issue should be resolved, aligning the function implementation with the expected usage and HLS requirements.
