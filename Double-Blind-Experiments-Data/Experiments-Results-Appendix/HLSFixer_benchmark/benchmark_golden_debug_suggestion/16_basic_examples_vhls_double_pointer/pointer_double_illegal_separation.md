**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Observation and Compiler Error Log Analysis**:
   - The error log points out that there is a simulation result inconsistency, suggesting a logic error or unexpected behavior during execution but not a straightforward compilation syntax error.
   - Notably, it mentions "Files result.dat and result.golden.dat differ" which indicates the output of the simulation does not match the expected results.

2. **Code Review Based on Error Log**:
   - I noticed that the braces `{}` are missing in the control structures in the provided buggy code. This is critical as it affects the scope of the loops and conditional statements, leading to unexpected behavior.

3. **Identifying and Hypothesizing Errors**:
   - In the function `sub`, the for-loop and the subsequent conditional statement lack proper braces. Consequently, the conditional statement and the arithmetic operation are not part of the loop's scope as intended. This could lead to incorrect calculations as the operations intended to be repeated might only execute once.
   - Similarly, in the function `pointer_double`, the conditional check that updates the array based on the position also lacks proper braces. This means the assignment operation might not be properly conditioned, potentially leading to out-of-bound writes or incorrect updates.

4. **Proposing Fixes**:
   - For the `sub` function, add braces around the statements inside the for-loop to ensure they execute as part of the loop's body. The correct loop should encapsulate both the conditional check and the addition operation.
   - In the `pointer_double` function, ensure that the assignment operation `*(array+pos) = x;` is only executed when the condition `pos >= 0 & pos < 10` holds true by enclosing it in braces.

5. **Modified Code Proposal**:
   - Correct the `sub` function:
     ```cpp
     for(i=0; i<size; ++i) {
         if (**flagPtr & i) {
             x += *(ptr+i);
         }
     }
     ```
   - Correct the `pointer_double` function:
     ```cpp
     if (pos >=0 & pos < 10) {
         *(array+pos) = x;
     }
     ```

6. **Reflection and Verification**:
   - These corrections should address the logical errors due to misinterpretation of the scopes of conditional and loop structures. The changes should be verified by re-running the HLS simulation to ensure the output matches the expected results.
   - It's important to always use braces for loops and conditional statements in C/C++ to avoid such scope-related errors, especially in high-level synthesis where every cycle and operation count towards the final hardware design. 

This detailed step-by-step analysis and correction should resolve the simulation inconsistencies and lead to successful HLS synthesis of the provided code.
