Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Error Identification**:
   The Vitis HLS compiler error log suggests several issues, primarily centered around undeclared identifiers and the incorrect use of 'sqrt'. The first error message:
   ```
   "../../../../pointer_double.c:5:4: warning: implicitly declaring library function 'sqrt' with type 'double (double)'"
   ```
   alerts us to the misuse of `sqrt` where it seems to be incorrectly treated as a type.

2. **Analyzing the Issues**:
   - **Misuse of sqrt**: The compiler warning and errors suggest that `sqrt` is being misinterpreted as a type, which is incorrect. `sqrt` is a function in C/C++ used to compute the square root and needs the inclusion of `<math.h>` when used as such. However, it appears that the intent was not to declare variables of a non-existent 'sqrt' type. This leads to subsequent errors as the compiler does not recognize `x` and `i` as declared variables:
     ```
     "error: expected ';' after expression"
     "error: use of undeclared identifier 'x'"
     "error: use of undeclared identifier 'i'"
     ```
     These errors cascade through the rest of the function where `x` and `i` are used.

3. **Proposed Fixes**:
   - **Correct Variable Declaration**: Replace `sqrt x, i;` with the correct type for the variables intended. Assuming `data_t` is a type defined in the included header "pointer_double.h", the declaration should be:
     ```cpp
     data_t x, i;
     ```
   This change should resolve the undeclared identifier errors for `x` and `i` throughout the function.

4. **Reflecting and Verifying**:
   - After correcting the declaration of `x` and `i`, the syntax of the rest of the code should be re-evaluated to ensure no other syntax or contextual errors remain. The logic within the functions should also be reviewed to ensure it meets the functional requirements, assuming `data_t` and related pointers are utilized correctly as per their definitions in "pointer_double.h".

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Implement the proposed fix.
   - Compile the code again to check if the errors regarding undeclared identifiers and the misuse of `sqrt` are resolved.
   - Further test the functionality to ensure that the logic of adding to `x` in the `sub` function and updating `array` in `pointer_double` function behaves as expected.

By correcting the type declaration from `sqrt x, i;` to `data_t x, i;`, the code should align better with standard C/C++ practices, and the errors highlighted in the error log should be resolved. This should allow the code to compile and potentially function as intended, assuming `data_t` and the operations performed are logically correct and compatible with HLS requirements.
