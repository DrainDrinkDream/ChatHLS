Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Error Identification and Analysis**:
   - The compiler error log indicates multiple instances of an "undefined reference to `pointer_double`". This suggests that the function `pointer_double` is expected by other parts of the program (likely in a test script or another file that uses this function), but it is not found in the provided code.

2. **Diagnosis**:
   - In the buggy code, the function that seems to correspond to `pointer_double` is actually named `point_double`. This discrepancy in naming is the root cause for the undefined reference errors, as the linker fails to find the expected `pointer_double` function.

3. **Proposed Fix**:
   - Rename the function `point_double` to `pointer_double` to match the expected function name. This should resolve the linker errors about undefined references. Ensure that all references to this function within the project are consistent with this name.

4. **Detailed Changes**:
   - Change the function declaration from `data_t point_double(data_t pos, data_t x, data_t* flag)` to `data_t pointer_double(data_t pos, data_t x, data_t* flag)`.

5. **Reflection**:
   - After renaming the function, it's important to recompile the code to ensure that the change has resolved the linker errors. If there are additional errors or if the function signature is supposed to be different (parameters or usage), those would need to be addressed next. However, based on the current error log, the primary issue appears to be the incorrect function name.

By following these steps, the initial HLS compilation issue regarding the undefined function reference should be resolved, allowing further testing or synthesis steps to proceed without this particular error.
