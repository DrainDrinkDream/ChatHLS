Chain of Thought (CoT):
1. **Analyzing Compiler Error Log**:
   - First, the error log mentions: "error: use of undeclared identifier 'new'" and similarly for 'delete'. This error indicates that the compiler does not recognize 'new' and 'delete' as valid operations, which are standard for dynamic memory allocation in C++. Given that HLS often requires fixed-size memory usage for synthesis, the use of dynamic allocation can be problematic. Moreover, 'new' and 'delete' are not available in plain C, and it seems that the compiler settings could be treating the code as C rather than C++ or the HLS tool does not support dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Debugging Strategy Based on Error Log**:
   - To fix the issues, we should avoid dynamic memory allocation in the HLS environment and use static arrays instead. This approach is consistent with the requirements of many HLS tools, which prefer predictable memory usage patterns.

3. **Proposed Code Modifications**:
   - Eliminate dynamic memory allocation (the line with `new` and `delete`). Instead, rely on static allocation as demonstrated in the error-free original code.
   - Replace:
     ```cpp
     data_t* array_1 = new data_t[10]; 
     ```
     with:
     ```cpp
     // Removed as no dynamic allocation is required
     ```
   - And remove:
     ```cpp
     delete[] array_1;
     ```
     with:
     ```cpp
     // Removed as no dynamic allocation is used
     ```

4. **Verification and Reflection**:
   - After removing the dynamic allocation, re-run the HLS tool to check if the errors about 'new' and 'delete' are resolved. This should address the compilation errors and allow the HLS tool to proceed with further synthesis steps.
   - Reflecting on the changes, it becomes apparent that maintaining a consistent memory allocation strategy (preferably static in the context of HLS) is crucial for HLS compatibility. Dynamic memory features like `new` and `delete` are not only incompatible but also introduce uncertainties in memory usage, which is undesirable in a hardware synthesis context.

5. **Final Step**:
   - Review the entire code to ensure that all other aspects are in line with HLS requirements. Ensure that no other dynamic memory allocations or unsupported features are used in the code.
   - With these changes, the code should be closer to HLS-compatible, and further testing in the HLS environment will validate if the modifications are sufficient.
