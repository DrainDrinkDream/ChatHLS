**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identify Errors**:
   From the error log, the compiler has flagged an issue on line 25:
   ```
   '../../../../pointer_double.c:25:22: warning: missing terminating ' character\n', "      *(array+pos) = 'x;\n",
   '../../../../pointer_double.c:25:22: error: expected expression\n',
   ```
   This error suggests that there is a syntax error related to a character literal that is not properly closed or incorrectly used.

2. **Analyze Reasons**:
   The line in question from the buggy code is:
   ```cpp
   *(array+pos) = 'x;
   ```
   This line attempts to assign the value 'x to an element in the array. However, the single quote character `'` is used incorrectly. In C/C++, character literals are enclosed in single quotes, and each must have a matching pair to be valid. The compiler's complaint about a missing terminating character `'` indicates that the closing quote is absent, which disrupts the syntax.

3. **Propose Fixes**:
   To correct this error, replace `'x` with `x`, to correctly use the variable `x` instead of an invalid character literal:
   ```cpp
   *(array+pos) = x;
   ```
   This change assigns the value of `x` to the specified array position, matching the intended functionality and correcting the syntax error.

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   After modifying the code to `*(array+pos) = x;`, recompile the code. The syntax error should be resolved as the character literal is now properly used as a variable.

5. **Reflection**:
   The error was straightforward, involving a simple syntax mistake with character literals. Correcting this involved ensuring that the variable is used directly without being mistakenly wrapped as a character. This type of error is easily caught by the compiler, and careful attention to the syntax when writing or reviewing code can prevent it. The next steps would involve checking for any further syntax or logical issues, but given the compiler error log, this was the primary concern that needed addressing.
