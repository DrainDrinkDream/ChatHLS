Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - The error log from the Vitis HLS compiler indicates a specific syntax error: "expected ';' after expression" at line 25 of the `pointer_double.c` file. The problematic line is highlighted as `*(array+pos) = x`.

2. **Error Identification**:
   - Upon examining the indicated line `*(array+pos) = x`, it is apparent that the line lacks a semicolon (`;`) at the end. In C++, every statement must end with a semicolon to denote the end of the statement. This syntax rule is violated here.

3. **Proposed Fix**:
   - To rectify this syntax error, a semicolon should be added at the end of the line. Therefore, the line should be corrected to:
     ```cpp
     *(array+pos) = x;
     ```

4. **Additional Observations**:
   - Although the compiler error log only points out the missing semicolon, it is prudent to review the surrounding code to spot any potential logical or syntax errors that might not have been reached due to the compilation stopping at the first error.
   - The use of the bitwise operator `&` in the condition `if (**flagPtr & i)` and `if (pos >=0 & pos < 10)` should be scrutinized. Typically, logical conditions are intended to use logical AND `&&` rather than bitwise AND `&`. However, without specific information about the intended functionality or further errors pointing to this as an issue, it remains a hypothesis that these might be bugs or might be intended operations.

5. **Reflecting and Next Steps**:
   - After adding the missing semicolon, the next step would be to recompile the program to check if any further errors are reported by the compiler. If the hypothesis about the misuse of `&` is correct, it might appear in subsequent compilations as logical errors, or if the functionality tests fail.
   - If no further compilation errors occur, functionality tests or simulations should be conducted to ensure the program behaves as expected, particularly testing scenarios around the use of the `&` operator in conditions.

In summary, the immediate fix for the compilation error is to add a semicolon at the end of line 25 in `pointer_double.c`. Further investigation and testing may be required to validate the use of bitwise operators in conditional statements within the program.
