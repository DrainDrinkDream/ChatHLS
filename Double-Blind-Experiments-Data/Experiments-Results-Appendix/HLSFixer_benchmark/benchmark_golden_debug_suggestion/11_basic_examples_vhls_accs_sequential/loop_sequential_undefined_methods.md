Chain of Thought (CoT):

Upon reviewing the error log provided by the Vitis HLS compiler, it is clear that the primary issue causing the compilation error is related to a non-existent function called `undefined_function()`. The error log specifically states:

../../../../loop_sequential.cpp:19:3: error: ‘undefined_function’ was not declared in this scope
   undefined_function();
   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This error message indicates that `undefined_function()` is being called at line 19 in the `loop_sequential.cpp` file but it has not been declared anywhere in the scope of the project files, nor is it a standard function recognized by the compiler. 

Given that this is the only error that stopped the compilation process, the first and most critical step is to remove or comment out the call to `undefined_function()` to ascertain if there are any further errors preventing the successful compilation of the code. This function call appears to be either a leftover from debugging or a mistakenly placed function call. 

The correction is simple:
- Remove the line `undefined_function();` from the code.

After making this change, the next logical step would be to recompile the code. If there are no further errors, one could reasonably conclude that this was the only issue preventing the code from compiling. If more errors surface after this fix, they can then be addressed sequentially based on the new compiler output.

Reflecting on this debugging process, it is evident that unresolved function calls are a common source of compilation errors in C/C++ programming. It is crucial to ensure that all functions used in the code are correctly declared or included from appropriate libraries.

To prevent such errors in the future, it would be beneficial to periodically compile the code during development to catch such issues early on. Additionally, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a code editor with C/C++ syntax highlighting and error detection can help identify undeclared functions before attempting to compile.

This fix should resolve the current compilation error, and the code should be ready for further testing or synthesis steps in the HLS process.
