Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Observation and Error Identification**:
   - Upon reviewing the compiler error log, it clearly indicates a syntax error in the file `loop_sequential.cpp`. The specific error message points out: "expected ';' before '}' token" at the line containing `Y[i] = Y_accum`. This suggests a missing semicolon at the end of this line.

2. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - Based on the error message from the compiler, my hypothesis is that the missing semicolon is causing the compilation to fail. In C++, every statement must end with a semicolon, and the absence of it can disrupt the parsing of the code, leading to compilation errors.

3. **Code Inspection and Error Analysis**:
   - I checked the line indicated by the error message (`Y[i] = Y_accum`) in the provided buggy code. Indeed, this line lacks a semicolon at the end, which aligns with the error reported in the log.

4. **Proposed Fix**:
   - To resolve this error, I need to add a semicolon at the end of the line `Y[i] = Y_accum;`. This change should allow the compiler to correctly parse and compile the code.

5. **Testing and Verification**:
   - After adding the semicolon, recompiling the code should lead to a successful compilation since this appears to be the only syntax error mentioned in the error log.

6. **Reflection and Conclusion**:
   - The error was straightforward to resolve once identified. The error log was crucial in pinpointing the exact location and nature of the syntax error. With the error fixed, the code should now compile without any issues, assuming there are no other hidden errors not captured in the provided logs.

By following these debugging steps, I was able to efficiently identify and correct the error in the HLS code based on the provided compiler error log.
