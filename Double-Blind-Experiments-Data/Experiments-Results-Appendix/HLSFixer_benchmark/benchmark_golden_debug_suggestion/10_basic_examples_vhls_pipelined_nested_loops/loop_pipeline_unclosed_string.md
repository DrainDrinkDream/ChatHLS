**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Starting with the Syntax Errors**:
    - The error log indicates a primary syntax error related to a missing terminating `'` character. This error is highlighted at the loop label `'LOOP_I:for(i=0; i < 20; i++){`. It's evident that the single quotation mark `'` is not required and mistakenly placed before `LOOP_I`.
    - The error log also points out issues at the global scope and a missing return statement. These are likely cascading errors caused by the initial misplacement of the quotation mark, which disrupts the parsing of the subsequent code.

2. **Analyzing and Hypothesizing**:
    - The quotation mark is supposed to denote a string or a character, but in this context, it seems to be used incorrectly as loop labels in HLS should not be enclosed in quotes. The error message "`../../../../loop_pipeline.cpp:8:2: error: missing terminating ' character`" further supports this hypothesis, indicating that the compiler is treating everything after the quote as a string, thus leading to syntax parsing issues.

3. **Testing and Verification**:
    - Remove the misplaced quotation mark at the beginning of the loop label. This should resolve the parsing issues and restore the function's structure, allowing the compiler to recognize the loop labels and the return statement correctly.

4. **Reflection and Next Steps**:
    - After removing the quotation mark, re-examine the code to ensure no further syntax issues are present. This would involve compiling the code again and checking if any new errors appear in the log.
    - Given the error logs mention "`../../../../loop_pipeline.cpp:12:2: error: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Werror=return-type]`", it is critical to ensure that the return statement is correctly recognized after fixing the primary syntax error.

**Proposed Fix**:
- Change the line `'LOOP_I:for(i=0; i < 20; i++){` to `LOOP_I:for(i=0; i < 20; i++){`.

This single change addresses the root cause identified and should resolve the syntax errors, allowing the compiler to correctly parse the rest of the function and recognize the return statement. Upon recompilation, the error messages should cease if the fix is successful, confirming the hypothesis and the effectiveness of the debugging strategy.
