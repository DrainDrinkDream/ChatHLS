**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Error Analysis**:
   - The compiler error log explicitly points out a syntax error in the file `loop_pipeline.cpp` at line 10. The specific message says `expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token` and highlights `acc += A[j] * i`. This indicates a missing semicolon at the end of the expression inside the nested loop. 

2. **Comparison and Hypothesis Formation**:
   - Given this error, the hypothesis is straightforward: the absence of the semicolon is causing a syntax error which prevents the program from compiling. This kind of error is common in C/C++ where each statement must end with a semicolon.

3. **Proposed Fix**:
   - To resolve this error, simply add a semicolon at the end of the statement `acc += A[j] * i;` within the nested loop. This should make the statement syntactically correct and allow the program to compile.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After adding the semicolon, recompilation should be attempted to ensure that this resolves the syntax error. If the compiler passes this line without further errors, it means the fix was correct.

5. **Reflection and Further Actions**:
   - Once the syntax error is fixed, it's essential to test the program to ensure it behaves as expected functionally. Further analysis should be done if there are runtime errors or logical issues, but currently, there are no indications of such from the compiler error log.

6. **Summary**:
   - The error was purely syntactical caused by a missing semicolon. Fixing it should allow the program to compile, progressing towards further testing phases like C-Simulation or even synthesis, provided no other errors exist.

In conclusion, the debugging strategy based on the provided compiler error log was effective in identifying and proposing a fix for the syntax error in the provided HLS code.
