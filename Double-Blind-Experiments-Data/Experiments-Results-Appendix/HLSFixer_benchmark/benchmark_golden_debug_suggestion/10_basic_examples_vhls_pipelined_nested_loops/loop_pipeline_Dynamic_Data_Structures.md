**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial error assessment**:
   - The compiler error log indicates issues with the use of dynamic memory allocation (`new` and `delete[]`). Specifically, the errors:
     ```
     ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'loop_pipeline(ap_int<5>*)': Undefined function operator new[] (loop_pipeline.cpp:6:13)
     ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'loop_pipeline(ap_int<5>*)': Undefined function operator delete[] (loop_pipeline.cpp:15:2)
     ```
     These errors suggest that High-Level Synthesis (HLS) does not support dynamic memory allocation, which is a common limitation in HLS environments due to the need for deterministic resource allocation at synthesis time.

2. **Assessing the necessity of dynamic memory allocation**:
   - Upon examining the use of `A1`, it becomes apparent that this dynamically allocated array is not actually used anywhere in the computation that affects the output. It seems to be an extraneous addition to the code. This leads to the hypothesis that removing `A1` (both its declaration and deletion) should not affect the functionality but will help in resolving the HLS compatibility issue.

3. **Proposed code modifications**:
   - Remove the lines:
     ```cpp
     int* A1 = new int[N];
     ```
     and 
     ```cpp
     delete[] A1;
     ```
     This would eliminate the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, which are not supported by HLS as indicated by the errors.

4. **Reflection and additional checks**:
   - After removing the dynamic memory allocation, there are no other HLS-related errors indicated in the log. The rest of the code does not contain operations generally incompatible with HLS, such as recursion, further dynamic memory use, or unsupported library functions. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that these changes should resolve the synthesis failures.

5. **Final step**:
   - With the problematic HLS-incompatible operations removed, the code should now be compatible with HLS requirements, focusing purely on the static computation and loop constructs which are typically well-handled in HLS.

By following the above steps and reasoning based on the compiler error messages, the code has been adjusted to be suitable for HLS without altering its intended functionality. This should allow the HLS tool to successfully synthesize the design.
