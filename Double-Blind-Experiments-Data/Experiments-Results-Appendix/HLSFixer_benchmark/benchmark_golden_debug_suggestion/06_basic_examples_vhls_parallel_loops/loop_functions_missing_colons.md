Chain of Thought (CoT):
```text
Upon reviewing the compiler error log, the first and most apparent issue highlighted is a syntax error. The log points out a missing semicolon at the end of a function call. Specifically, the log states: "../../../../loop_functions.cpp:20:23: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token". This error is found in the line with the call to the function `sub_func(B, Y, ylimit)`. The provided log clearly indicates the absence of a semicolon (;) at the end of the function call, which is crucial in C++ to denote the end of a statement.

Analyzing the buggy code, the specific line in question is:
```cpp
sub_func(B,Y,ylimit)
```
In C++, every statement must end with a semicolon. The omission of the semicolon in this line causes the compiler to fail as it continues to read into the next bracket expecting the end of the statement, thus leading to the compilation error.

To resolve this error, I would add a semicolon at the end of this line. The corrected line would be:
```cpp
sub_func(B,Y,ylimit);
```
This modification will make the code syntactically correct, allowing the compiler to properly understand the end of the function call statement, thereby resolving the current compilation error.

Upon fixing this syntax error, I would then compile the code again to check for further errors. If there are no more errors, the fix can be considered successful. If other errors appear, I would address them sequentially based on the information provided by the compiler error log, always ensuring that each modification maintains the logical integrity and functional requirements of the original program specifications.

Reflecting on this fix, the error was straightforward due to the explicit nature of compiler syntax errors. The solution simply involved adhering to the syntactical rules of C++, which are critical for successful compilation. Any further errors would be handled with similar meticulous attention to the details provided by the error log.
