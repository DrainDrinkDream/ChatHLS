**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Identification**:
   The Vitis HLS compiler error log indicates the presence of errors related to dynamic memory allocation in the `sub_func` function. Specifically, the `new[]` and `delete[]` operators are mentioned as undefined. The error messages are:
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'sub_func(...)': Undefined function operator new[] (loop_functions.cpp:6:23)"
   - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'sub_func(...)': Undefined function operator delete[] (loop_functions.cpp:12:3)"

2. **Analyzing Reasons**:
   HLS tools generally do not support dynamic memory allocation through `new` and `delete` operators because they target FPGA hardware, which requires static and deterministic memory usage for synthesis. The presence of these operators in the code is likely causing the synthesis process to fail.

3. **Propose Fixes**:
   Since dynamic memory allocation is not supported in the HLS context, the straightforward fix is to remove these operations from the code. Analyzing the functionality, it appears that the dynamic array created (`dynamic_array`) is not used anywhere in the code logic. Therefore, it can be removed without impacting the functionality of the `sub_func`.

   - Remove the line that declares and initializes `dynamic_array`:
     ```cpp
     int* dynamic_array = new int[10];
     ```
   - Remove the line that deletes `dynamic_array`:
     ```cpp
     delete[] dynamic_array;
     ```

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   After removing the lines involving dynamic memory allocation, we should check if the code compiles and synthesizes without errors in the HLS tool. This step is critical to verify that the proposed solution not only resolves the compiler errors but also maintains the intended functionality of the code.

5. **Reflection**:
   The removal of unsupported HLS features such as dynamic memory allocation should resolve the synthesis errors. This step reinforces the understanding that HLS code must adhere to certain restrictions typical of hardware design, such as avoiding non-deterministic memory usage. Additionally, this exercise highlights the importance of reviewing the entire codebase for hardware compatibility issues when preparing code for HLS, even if certain parts of the code (like the unused dynamic array) might initially seem innocuous. 

By following these steps, the issues identified by the HLS compiler should be resolved, enabling the code to be synthesized successfully for FPGA deployment.
