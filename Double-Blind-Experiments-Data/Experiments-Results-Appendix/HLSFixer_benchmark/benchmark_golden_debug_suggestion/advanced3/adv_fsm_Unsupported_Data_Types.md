**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the Errors**:
   - The error log shows multiple instances of the same types of errors. The key ones revolve around the declaration and use of `IDLE`, `S1`, and `S10` where they are said not to be declared or recognized by the compiler. The repeated occurrence of these errors points to an issue with how these constants are declared and used throughout the code.

2. **Analyzing the Reasons**:
   - The errors from the compiler indicate that the `states` enumeration is not recognized as such. In the buggy code, `states` are declared using `class states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 }`, which is syntactically incorrect for defining an enum in C++. The compiler misinterprets this and hence fails to recognize `IDLE`, `S1`, and `S10` as valid identifiers in the subsequent code.
   - The compiler suggests alternatives like `FILE` for `IDLE` and `y1` for `S1`, confirming that it does not recognize these identifiers because they are not declared properly as enumeration members.

3. **Proposing Fixes**:
   - Change the incorrect enum declaration from `class states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 }` to the correct form `enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 };`. The syntax `enum` is used to declare enumeration types in C++, and `class` is inappropriate in this context.
   - Add a semicolon `;` at the end of the enum declaration to complete the statement correctly.

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   - After correcting the enum declaration, recompile the code. This should resolve the errors related to `IDLE`, `S1`, and `S10` not being recognized, as these will now be correctly defined as enumeration constants.
   - Check for any further errors in the log after recompilation. If the enum was the root cause, fixing it should clear up all related errors.

5. **Reflection**:
   - The main issue stemmed from a fundamental syntax error in declaring enum types. This was misleading the compiler to throw multiple errors wherever the enum constants were used.
   - After fixing the declaration, the structure and logic of the code should behave as intended because the rest of the code correctly uses these constants in a switch-case statement and other conditional logic.
   - Reflecting on this, ensuring correct syntax and understanding of C++ data types and their declarations is crucial, especially when dealing with compilers that are strict about type safety and declarations like in HLS environments.

By following these steps, the code should now compile without errors, and the functionality intended in the design of the finite state machine should be retained without any logical errors.
