**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Review and Compiler Error Identification**
   - From the error log, the primary error reported is: "`../../../../adv_fsm.cpp:65:5: error: ‘let’ was not declared in this scope`". This suggests that there's an issue with the keyword "let" which is not recognized by the compiler since it's not a valid C++ keyword.

2. **Analysis of the Specific Error**
   - The error points to the line `let *z = z_internal;`. In standard C++, there's no keyword "let"; it seems likely to be a typographical error or a misunderstanding of the syntax for pointer assignment. This needs to be corrected to use the correct syntax for assigning a value to a pointer.

3. **Proposed Fix**
   - Replace `let *z = z_internal;` with `*z = z_internal;`. This change corrects the syntax by using the dereference operator to assign the value of `z_internal` to the memory location pointed to by `z`. This is the standard method in C++ to assign a value to a pointer.

4. **Reflection and Verification**
   - After correcting the syntax error, the next logical step is to recompile the code. The expectation is that this should resolve the compilation error as there are no other syntax errors evident from the initial review or the error log.

5. **Consideration of Further Implications**
   - Given that the only error reported was related to a syntax issue with the misuse of a keyword, no further immediate issues are apparent. However, it would be prudent to run additional tests and simulations (C-SIM and potentially C-SYNTH) post-compilation to ensure there are no runtime logical errors or issues with the behavior of the state machine as implemented.

6. **Final Steps**
   - After ensuring the code compiles without errors, thorough testing should be conducted, especially focusing on the logic of the state transitions and output assignments, to confirm the finite state machine operates as expected. This will validate that the intended functionality to detect the sequence "101" and reset behavior is correctly implemented.

By following this structured approach, we've identified and proposed a fix for the immediate compilation error, set up a plan for subsequent verification, and considered broader testing to ensure overall functional integrity.
