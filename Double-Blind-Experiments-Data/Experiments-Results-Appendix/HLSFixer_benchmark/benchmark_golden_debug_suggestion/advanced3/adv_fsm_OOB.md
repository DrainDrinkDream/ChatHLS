**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Compilation Error Analysis**:
   The compiler error log indicates several issues:
   - Error at line 8 regarding an expected initializer before `present_state`.
   - Error at line 9 where `present_state` was not declared in the scope.
   - Error at line 43 with an invalid conversion from `int` to `states`.

2. **Addressing the Syntax Error in Enum Declaration**:
   - The error on line 8 suggests a syntax issue with the enum declaration or its usage. In C++, enums should end with a semicolon. In the buggy code, the enum declaration `enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 }` lacks a semicolon at the end. This is likely causing the subsequent errors about `present_state` not being recognized because the enum type `states` wasn't properly closed and defined.
   - **Fix**: Add a semicolon at the end of the enum declaration:
     ```cpp
     enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 };
     ```

3. **Testing the Fix for Syntax Error**:
   - After adding the semicolon, recompile the code. This should resolve both the errors on lines 8 and 9 since `states` and `present_state` will now be correctly recognized.

4. **Addressing the Logic Error in State Transitions**:
   - The error on line 43, an invalid conversion from `int` to `states` at `next_state = S10 + 1;`, indicates an attempt to assign an integer value to an enumeration type. This is incorrect because enums in C++ are not implicitly convertible to integer types unless explicitly defined or cast.
   - In the context of a finite state machine, the state `S10 + 1` does not make sense as there is no defined state corresponding to this expression. It appears to be a logical error, likely meant to reset to some specific state based on the design of the finite state machine.

5. **Proposing a Logical Fix**:
   - Consider the purpose of the finite state machine and the conditions under which a transition should occur. The state `S10` represents a part of a sequence, and upon receiving the next input, it should decide the next valid state logically.
   - Based on typical FSM design and in alignment with sequence pattern detection (e.g., detecting "101"), after `S10`, if `x == 1`, it should transition to `IDLE`, indicating the completion of the sequence.
   - **Fix**: Change the erroneous line to transition back to `IDLE` instead of using an undefined state:
     ```cpp
     next_state = IDLE;
     z_internal = 1;
     ```

6. **Final Verification**:
   - With the syntax and logical errors addressed, recompile the code. Verify that the errors are resolved and that the finite state machine behaves as expected, detecting sequences and resetting appropriately.

7. **Reflection**:
   - This debugging session involved addressing both syntax errors that prevented compilation and a logical error that could lead to incorrect behavior of the state machine. Each error was tackled sequentially, first ensuring the code syntax was correct, and then ensuring that the logic matched the intended design of the system.
