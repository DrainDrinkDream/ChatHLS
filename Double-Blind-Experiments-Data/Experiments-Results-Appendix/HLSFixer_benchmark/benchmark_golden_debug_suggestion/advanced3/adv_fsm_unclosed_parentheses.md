**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the Error from Compiler Logs**:
   - The error log points out several issues near the `if` statement in the `IDLE` case of the switch statement. Specifically, it mentions an "expected `;` before `{` token" and "expected primary-expression before `else`". Additionally, it notes an "expected `)`" indicating an issue with parentheses.

2. **Analyzing the Error in Code**:
   - Upon reviewing the corresponding line in the buggy code:
     ```cpp
     if (x == 1 {
     ```
     It's apparent that there's a missing parenthesis at the end of the condition in the `if` statement. This missing parenthesis causes the compiler to not understand the end of the condition, leading to the cascade of errors that follow, including the misplaced semicolon and the problems with the `else` statement.

3. **Proposing a Fix**:
   - To resolve this error, I need to add a closing parenthesis at the end of the condition in the `if` statement:
     ```cpp
     if (x == 1) {
     ```
   - This should close the condition properly, allowing the compiler to understand the block structure correctly and resolve the cascade of syntax errors.

4. **Reflection and Next Steps**:
   - After adding the missing parenthesis, I should recompile the code to check if this resolves the compilation errors. Due to the nature of syntax errors, they need to be resolved first as they can obscure other potential issues in the code by preventing proper parsing and compilation.
   - Assuming the syntax error was the primary issue (as suggested by the nature and focus of the error log), fixing it should allow for successful compilation. If further issues are revealed after fixing the syntax, I would then address them sequentially as they appear.

In summary, the primary issue found in the code was a syntactical mistake involving a missing parenthesis in an `if` statement. Fixing this should allow the code to compile and should address the immediate errors reported in the log. Further testing is necessary after this fix to ensure no additional logical or runtime errors are present.
