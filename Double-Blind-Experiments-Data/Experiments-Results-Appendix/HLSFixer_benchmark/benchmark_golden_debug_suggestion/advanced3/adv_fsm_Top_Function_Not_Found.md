**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identify the Top Function Not Found Error**:
   - The error log mentions an undefined reference to `adv_fsm(ap_uint<1>, ap_uint<1>, ap_uint<1>*)` during the linking phase in the compiler's output. This suggests that the function `adv_fsm` is expected as the entry point (or top function) for the HLS synthesis and simulation but is not found in the provided code. Instead, a function named `advance_fsm` is defined.

2. **Hypothesis about Function Naming**:
   - The error strongly indicates a mismatch between the function name expected by the testbench or the HLS settings (`adv_fsm`) and the actual function name in the code (`advance_fsm`). This can happen due to a manual error in naming or a misunderstanding of the specification.

3. **Proposed Fix for Function Naming**:
   - Rename `advance_fsm` to `adv_fsm` in the provided code to match the expected function name. This would resolve the linker error as the correct entry point would then be defined.
   - Change the declaration line from:
     ```cpp
     void advance_fsm(bit_t reset, bit_t x, bit_t* z)
     ```
     to:
     ```cpp
     void adv_fsm(bit_t reset, bit_t x, bit_t* z)
     ```

4. **Validation of the Fix**:
   - After renaming the function, recompile the code. Check if the linker error regarding the undefined reference to `adv_fsm` is resolved. This should allow the compilation to proceed without the 'Top Function Not Found' error.

5. **Reflect and Plan Next Steps**:
   - Once the function naming issue is resolved, further testing and synthesis can be conducted to ensure that there are no additional logical or syntactic errors in the HLS code.
   - It is also crucial to validate that the behavior of the HLS implementation matches the intended design specification, particularly that the FSM correctly detects the sequence '101'.

6. **Summary**:
   - The primary issue detected from the error log was related to an incorrect function name which prevented successful linking and simulation. The proposed fix involves renaming the function to align with expectations from the test environment or the HLS project settings.
   - This scenario underscores the importance of consistency in naming conventions and thorough checking of integration points (like function names) between different components of a project (e.g., testbench and HLS code).
