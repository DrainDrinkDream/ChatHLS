**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Analyzing the Compiler Error Log:** 
   The error log specifically points to an issue at line 46 of the buggy code, indicating that the function `handleInvalidInput` was not declared in this scope. This is a clear indication that the function is either not defined or not included in the current code, resulting in a compilation error.

2. **Identifying the Bug in the Code:**
   Upon examining the buggy code at line 46, it tries to assign the result of `handleInvalidInput(x)` to `next_state` within the `case S10:` of the switch statement. Since there's no definition or declaration of `handleInvalidInput` in the given code, this results in the compiler error as observed.

3. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   Since the function `handleInvalidInput` is undefined and not mentioned elsewhere in the code or in the error log, it seems like an accidental inclusion or a placeholder that was not replaced with actual logic. A common practice in handling unexpected input in a finite state machine (FSM) is to reset or revert to a known safe state, often the initial state.

4. **Testing and Verification:**
   To verify the hypothesis, the typical handling in FSMs for invalid or unexpected input is to revert to the initial state or to continue with no state change depending on the FSM design. Given that the original code is not accessible in this task, this assumption aligns with common FSM practices.

5. **Proposed Fix:**
   - Replace the line `next_state = handleInvalidInput(x);` with `next_state = IDLE;`. This change assigns the FSM to revert to the `IDLE` state if the input is unexpected in the `S10` state, aligning with typical FSM error handling.
   
   ```cpp
   case S10:
       if (x == 1) {
           next_state = IDLE;
           z_internal = 1;
       } else {
           next_state = IDLE; // Updated from handleInvalidInput(x) to IDLE
           z_internal = 0;
       }
       break;
   ```

6. **Reflection:**
   The debugging process focused on the explicit error provided by the compiler log, which clearly indicated a missing declaration. By understanding the context of FSMs and common error handling strategies, the fix proposes reverting to a known state (`IDLE`) instead of using an undefined function. This approach not only resolves the compilation error but also ensures that the FSM behaves predictably in cases of unexpected input. Further testing and simulation would be necessary to validate that this change integrates well with the rest of the FSM logic.
