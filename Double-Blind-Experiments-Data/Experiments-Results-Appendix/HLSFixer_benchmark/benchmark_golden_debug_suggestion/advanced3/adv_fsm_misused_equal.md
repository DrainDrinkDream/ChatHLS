**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Identification and Analysis**:
   - The compiler error log points to a syntax error at line 8: "expected initializer before ‘present_state’". This indicates an issue with the declaration or syntax around `present_state`.
   - Additionally, it mentions that `present_state` is not declared in the scope on line 9. This is a direct result of the first error.

2. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - The error suggests that the compiler is failing to recognize `present_state` as a valid variable. Given the nature of the error, it's likely that the declaration syntax of the enum `states` or its usage might be incorrect.

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Examining the line where `states` is declared (`enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 }`), a semicolon is missing at the end. Normally in C/C++, enum declarations need to be terminated with a semicolon.
   - By fixing the semicolon issue, the declaration and subsequent usage of `states` and `present_state` should be recognized correctly by the compiler.

4. **Propose Fix**:
   - Add a semicolon at the end of the enum declaration:
     ```cpp
     enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 };
     ```

5. **Reflection and Further Investigation**:
   - After fixing the enum syntax, recompilation should resolve the previously mentioned syntax errors.
   - The next step is to check for any further syntax or logical issues that may arise or were masked by the initial error. This includes re-examining the use of variables and condition checks.

6. **Subsequent Error Identification**:
   - Review of the logic within the switch statement showed another potential issue: an assignment operation (`x = 1`) instead of a comparison operation (`x == 1`) in the `case S10:`. This mistake could lead to unintended behavior as it modifies the input `x` rather than just checking its value.

7. **Propose Fix for Logical Issue**:
   - Correct the assignment to a comparison in the `case S10:` statement:
     ```cpp
     if (x == 1) {
     ```

8. **Final Reflection**:
   - With these corrections, the code should now compile successfully and perform as expected based on the state machine logic. The structural and logical integrity of the code aligns with typical usage and best practices in C/C++ for state machine implementation.
   - It is crucial to always ensure proper syntax and logical operations conforming to the intended behavior, especially in condition checks and state transitions.
