**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Analysis with Compiler Error Log:**
   - The error log points to a specific syntax error at line 8: `'../../../../adv_fsm.cpp:8:19: error: expected initializer before ‘present_state’` This error suggests that there might be a syntax issue right before the declaration of `present_state`.
   - Following this, another error message at line 9 indicates that `'present_state’ was not declared in this scope`. This error typically cascades from the first syntax error, which prevented proper declaration and initialization of `present_state`.

2. **Identifying the Syntax Error:**
   - On examining the source code at the mentioned lines, I notice that the enumeration definition for `states` ends without a semicolon. In C++, enumerations are type definitions and require a semicolon at the end of their declaration.
   - This mistake would prevent the proper declaration of the subsequent variables (like `present_state`), leading exactly to the kind of errors reported by the compiler.

3. **Proposed Fix for Syntax Error:**
   - To correct this issue, I need to add a semicolon at the end of the enumeration definition. This should be:
     ```cpp
     enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 };
     ```

4. **Revising and Testing the Fix:**
   - After adding the semicolon, the definition now properly delineates the type, allowing for the subsequent declaration of `present_state` and `next_state` to be recognized by the compiler.
   - Recompiling the code should now pass the initial syntax check, resolving the initial errors pointing to the absence of `present_state`.

5. **Reflection on Fix and Further Actions:**
   - Adding the semicolon is a small change, but it corrects the cascade of syntax errors. After this fix, it would be prudent to recompile and rerun the code to ensure no further errors are present and that all variables are recognized in their proper scopes.
   - Assuming this was the only syntax error (as no other errors are shown in the log after this point), the compilation should now succeed, and the function should behave as expected during simulation.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The debugging process focused on identifying the root cause of the syntax error through careful analysis of the compiler error messages and the contextual code around the reported errors. The fix was straightforward once the issue was pinpointed and should resolve the compilation issues reported in the log.
