**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Analysis:**
   The first error in the compiler log is:
   ```text
   '../../../../adv_fsm.cpp:8:19: error: expected initializer before ‘present_state’
   static states present_state = IDLE;
   ```
   This indicates an issue with the declaration of `present_state`. The syntax error is likely due to the missing semicolon at the end of the `enum states` declaration.

2. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   In C++, enumerations must be terminated with a semicolon. If omitted, it leads to a syntax error, affecting the subsequent code that relies on the enumeration. This is supported by the error message, which points to the line just after the enum declaration.

3. **Testing and Verification:**
   By adding a semicolon after the enum declaration, like so:
   ```cpp
   enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 };
   ```
   This should resolve the syntax error, allowing the compiler to properly recognize the type `states` and its respective values.

4. **Reflection on Fix:**
   After fixing the enum declaration, recompile the code to check if the issue with `present_state` not being recognized is resolved.

5. **Next Error Analysis:**
   Assuming the previous fix is correct, the next error is:
   ```text
   '../../../../adv_fsm.cpp:51:9: error: case label not within a switch statement
       default:
   ```
   This suggests that the `default` case is misplaced or the enclosing `switch` statement is incorrectly structured.

6. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   Checking the structure of the switch statement, there appears to be an erroneous alignment or misplaced curly brace that causes the `default` case to be recognized as outside the switch statement.

7. **Testing and Verification:**
   Ensuring the `switch` statement is properly enclosed with braces and the `default` case is correctly placed inside it:
   ```cpp
   switch (present_state) {
       case IDLE:
           ...
       case S1:
           ...
       case S10:
           ...
       default:
           next_state = IDLE;
           z_internal = 0;
           break;
   }
   ```
   By structuring the switch statement correctly, the error regarding the `default` label should be resolved.

8. **Reflection on Overall Fix:**
   With the syntactical corrections (semicolon after enum and proper switch case structure), recompile the code. These changes should address all identified compiler errors from the log. If new errors emerge, analyze them similarly. 

9. **Final Verification:**
   After applying the fixes and assuming the code compiles without further errors, it can be concluded that the main issues were syntactic and related to the structure of the code blocks. Ensuring code syntax and structure aligns with C++ standards is crucial in HLS environments where small errors can lead to significant issues in synthesis and simulation.
