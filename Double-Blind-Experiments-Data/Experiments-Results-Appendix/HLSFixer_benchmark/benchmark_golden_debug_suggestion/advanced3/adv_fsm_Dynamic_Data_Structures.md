**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Starting with the Error Log**:
   The error log clearly states a "double free detected in tcache 2", which indicates an issue with dynamic memory allocation or deallocation. This points towards potential misuse of pointers or `new` and `delete` operations in C++.

2. **Identifying the Error in the Code**:
   Upon examining the code, I notice that the `present_state` is dynamically allocated using `new` and later deallocated using `delete`. This is unusual for HLS programming, as dynamic memory operations can lead to unpredictable behavior and are generally not supported efficiently.

   ```cpp
   static states* present_state = new states;
   *present_state = IDLE;
   ...
   delete present_state;
   ```

3. **Hypothesizing the Cause**:
   The error message and the use of dynamic memory suggest that the `delete present_state;` might be getting called multiple times or the pointer could be manipulated elsewhere leading to undefined behavior. In HLS, each function call is supposed to reset all static variables, and dynamically allocated memory goes against this paradigm, possibly leading to errors when managing memory explicitly.

4. **Proposing a Fix**:
   To fix this issue, I would change the dynamic allocation to static allocation. Instead of using a pointer, I would use a simple static variable which is safer and more predictable in the HLS context. This avoids the need for `new` and `delete` and ensures that the static variable's lifecycle is managed by the HLS tool effectively. Hereâ€™s how I would modify the code:

   Replace:
   ```cpp
   static states* present_state = new states;
   *present_state = IDLE;
   ...
   delete present_state;
   ```
   With:
   ```cpp
   static states present_state = IDLE;
   ```

   And update all uses of `*present_state` to `present_state`.

5. **Reflecting on the Findings**:
   The issue was rooted in the inappropriate use of dynamic memory allocation in an HLS environment, which is incompatible with the standard practices of HLS tool handling of state and memory. The proposed fix should resolve the runtime error by ensuring that the state management is compatible with HLS requirements and avoids any manual memory management.

6. **Planning Next Steps**:
   After applying the above changes, I should re-run the HLS simulation to ensure that the runtime error does not occur and that the FSM behaves as expected. If further issues arise, I would re-evaluate the modified sections and check for other potential discrepancies with HLS best practices or logical errors in the FSM implementation. If the simulation passes, I would proceed to synthesis to ensure the design meets all timing and resource constraints.
