**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Analysis and Error Identification**:
   - Starting with the error log, there's a syntax error at line 8, where `present_state` is declared twice which is unusual and incorrect syntax for C/C++. This likely causes the first compiler error "expected initializer before ‘present_state’". 

2. **Deeper Dive into Syntax Errors**:
   - In the buggy code, there seems to be a misunderstanding or typo in the declaration of the `states` enum and the variable `present_state`. The correct syntax should separate the enum declaration and the variable instantiation. This will address the error at line 8.

3. **Logical Errors and Missing Declarations**:
   - Most of the errors from the compiler log point towards the undeclared identifier `next_state`. This variable is crucial for state transitions but is not declared anywhere in the buggy code. This kind of error is common where the coder might forget to define a variable but uses it in their logic.

4. **Proposed Fixes Based on Analysis**:
   - First, correct the enum and present_state declaration to:
     ```cpp
     enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 };
     static states present_state = IDLE;
     ```
     This change fixes the syntax and removes ambiguity in declaration.
   - Next, add the declaration of `next_state` right after `present_state`:
     ```cpp
     states next_state = present_state;
     ```
     This declaration provides a starting state and aligns with the intended logic of keeping track of the next state.

5. **Reflection on Findings**:
   - These changes address both the syntax and logical errors found through the compiler error log. The missing declaration of `next_state` was a significant oversight as it's critical for the state transition logic. Adding this variable and correcting the enum declaration should align the code closer to the expected functionality of maintaining a finite state machine.

6. **Final Thoughts**:
   - After making these changes, it's expected that the code will compile successfully, and the finite state machine will function as intended, cycling through states based on the input `x` and outputting `z` when the sequence 101 is detected. The use of `static` for `present_state` ensures that the state is preserved across function calls, which is typical for state machines in embedded and simulation environments.

These steps and proposed changes should resolve the errors and enable correct functionality of the provided finite state machine code in HLS context.
