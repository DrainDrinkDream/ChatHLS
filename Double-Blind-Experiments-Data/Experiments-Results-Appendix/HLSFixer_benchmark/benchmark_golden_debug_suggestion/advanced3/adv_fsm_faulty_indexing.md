**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Analysis Using Compiler Error Log**:
    - The error log points out an issue with the definition and use of `present_state` in `adv_fsm.cpp`. The first error states an expected initializer before `present_state`, and the subsequent error indicates that `present_state` was not declared in the scope it's used. This suggests a syntactic issue around the declaration of `present_state`.

2. **Hypothesizing the Root Cause**:
    - Given that the error complains about the initializer and declaration, I first look at the line where `present_state` is declared. The error message points to the definition line "static states present_state = IDLE;" as problematic.
    - I observe that there is a semicolon missing at the end of the enum declaration. In C/C++, the `enum` declaration must be terminated with a semicolon.

3. **Proposing a Fix Based on Hypothesis**:
    - To resolve the issue, I will add a semicolon at the end of the `enum states` line. This should fix the syntactic issue causing the compiler to throw an error for the subsequent lines where `present_state` is used.

4. **Applying and Verifying the Fix**:
    - Modify the `enum states` line to: `enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=10 };`
    - Re-run the compiler to check if the error regarding `present_state` is resolved.

5. **Assessing the Result**:
    - After adding the semicolon, the compiler should recognize the `enum states` declaration properly, allowing `present_state` to be correctly identified in its scope.
    - If the compiler passes with no further errors related to `present_state`, the fix can be considered successful.

6. **Reflection on the Fix and Further Actions**:
    - The process highlights the importance of strict syntax adherence in C/C++ programming, especially for declarations. A simple omission like a semicolon can lead to cascading errors that obscure the actual issue.
    - It's crucial to carefully inspect compiler errors and trace them to their exact location in the code. Often, the line number given in the error does not precisely point to the syntax mistake but to where its effect becomes apparent.
    - If additional errors arise after this fix, they will be handled sequentially, with each addressed using a similar hypothesize-and-test approach.

By following this detailed thought process, the identified syntactic issue in the HLS C/C++ code was debugged effectively, leveraging direct information from the compiler error log.
