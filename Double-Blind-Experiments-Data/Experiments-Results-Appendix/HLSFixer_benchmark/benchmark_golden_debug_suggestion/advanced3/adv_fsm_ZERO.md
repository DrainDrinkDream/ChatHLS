**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Error Identification**:
   The compiler error log indicates an issue at line 8, stating "error: expected initializer before ‘present_state’". This suggests a problem with the declaration or syntax of the enumeration or its associated variable.

2. **Syntax Error Analysis**:
   Upon reviewing the buggy code, I noticed that the enumeration declaration `enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 }` lacks a semicolon at the end. This is a common syntax error in C/C++ which can prevent the compiler from recognizing subsequent declarations properly.

3. **Proposed Fix for Syntax Error**:
   To resolve this, I need to add a semicolon at the end of the enum declaration:
   ```cpp
   enum states { IDLE=0, S1=1, S10=2 };
   ```
   This change should correct the syntax and allow the compiler to recognize the declaration of `present_state` and `next_state`.

4. **Further Compiler Errors**:
   After the syntax error, another error states "‘present_state’ was not declared in this scope". This error is a direct result of the prior syntax issue. Once the syntax is corrected, this error should be resolved as the compiler will be able to recognize the `present_state`.

5. **Logical Error Evaluation**:
   Observing the logical flow, the current implementation sets `present_state = IDLE;` unconditionally at the end of the `adv_fsm` function, which would not allow the FSM to transition between states correctly. Instead, the state should be updated based on the `reset` signal and `next_state`.

6. **Proposed Fix for Logical Error**:
   Replace the unconditional resetting of `present_state` with a conditional structure:
   ```cpp
   if (reset) {
       present_state = IDLE;
   } else {
       present_state = next_state;
   }
   ```
   This change ensures that the FSM transitions between states unless a reset is applied.

7. **Reflection and Verification**:
   After making these changes, I will recompile the code. The syntax correction should resolve the initial compilation errors, and the logical fix should ensure that the FSM behaves as expected during simulations.

8. **Next Steps**:
   If any further errors are revealed in the compiler log or during functional simulation after these fixes, I will analyze them similarly: identify the error, understand its cause, propose a fix, and verify the solution.

By addressing these issues sequentially and logically, the HLS code should now compile correctly and function as intended in line with the FSM design requirements.
