**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Identification:**
   - The error log indicates that there's a syntax error related to the 'if' and 'else' statements. The specific error message is "error: expected ‘,’ or ‘;’ before ‘if’" pointing to the line with `if (load) {`.

2. **Analyzing Reasons:**
   - The error message suggests a syntax issue just before the 'if' statement. Syntax errors like these often occur due to missing punctuation in the preceding lines which confuses the compiler about where the previous statement ends and the new one begins.
   - By inspecting the line above `if (load) {`, it's apparent that the declaration of `static ap_uint<64> reg_q = 0` misses a semicolon (`;`) at the end. This absence likely caused the compiler to misinterpret the beginning of the 'if' statement, leading to the mentioned syntax errors.

3. **Propose Fixes:**
   - To correct this error, I should add a semicolon at the end of the line where `reg_q` is declared. The corrected line would be:
     ```cpp
     static ap_uint<64> reg_q = 0;
     ```

4. **Testing and Verification:**
   - After adding the semicolon, recompiling the code should resolve the syntax error regarding the 'if' statement. This should also resolve the subsequent error "`error: ‘else’ without a previous ‘if’`" since the 'if' statement now correctly closes and the 'else' statement can be recognized as linked to the previous 'if'.

5. **Reflection:**
   - The primary issue stemmed from a simple syntax oversight which cascaded into additional error messages. Correcting this has not only fixed the immediate syntax error but also aligned the control flow structure properly as expected by the compiler.
   - It's crucial in HLS, just as in any C/C++ programming, to ensure all statements are properly terminated to avoid syntax errors that can lead to misleading and cascading error messages during compilation.

By following this approach, I've identified the root cause based on the compiler error log, proposed a fix, and outlined how this change should resolve the identified issues. The process also highlights the importance of meticulous syntax adherence in programming to prevent compilation errors, especially in environments like HLS where precise control flow and data handling are crucial.
