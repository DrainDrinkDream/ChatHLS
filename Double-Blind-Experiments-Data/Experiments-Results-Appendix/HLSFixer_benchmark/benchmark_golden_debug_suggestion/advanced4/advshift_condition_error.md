Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Error Identification**:
   - The compiler error log states there's an issue at line 9, specifically indicating an expected ',' or ';' before 'if'. This kind of error usually points to a syntax problem just before the mentioned line. Reviewing the code, I see that the line `static ap_uint<64> reg_q = 0` lacks a semicolon at the end. This missing semicolon causes the compiler to not recognize the end of the statement, leading to misinterpretation of subsequent lines.

2. **Proposed Fix and Reasoning for the First Error**:
   - To resolve this syntax error, I should add a semicolon at the end of the line declaring `reg_q`. Thus, the corrected line should be:
     ```cpp
     static ap_uint<64> reg_q = 0;
     ```
   - This fix should clear the syntax error and allow the compiler to properly parse the 'if' statement that follows.

3. **Further Analysis of Error Log**:
   - The error log also mentions an 'else' without a previous 'if'. This error is reported likely because the previous 'if' statement was not recognized due to the syntax error. Fixing the semicolon issue should resolve this error as well.

4. **Verification of Logical Errors**:
   - After fixing the syntax errors, it's crucial to ensure that the logical operations within the 'if' and 'switch' statements are correctly aligned with expected functionality. A deeper look into the code structure and logical operations does not reveal further syntax issues, but it's essential to match the operations with expected functionality, especially in the shift operations.

5. **Reflection and Next Steps**:
   - After correcting the syntax error and ensuring the compiler can parse the rest of the code, I would move to compile and run the code again to check for further errors or runtime issues. If any further errors are reported, I would analyze them in the context of functionality and expected behavior, focusing next on logical errors if they exist.

By applying this detailed debugging process, focusing on syntax errors first, then logical errors, and finally testing and verifying the code, the issues should be resolved effectively.
