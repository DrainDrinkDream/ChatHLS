**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Starting Point**: First, I examined the error log which indicates a syntax error at a specific point in the buggy code. The log points out an issue with a missing parenthesis and semicolon.

2. **Identifying the Syntax Error**: The log mentions that there's an expected semicolon before 'acc' on line 9 of the code. Specifically, the error message is "`error: expected ‘;’ before ‘acc’`" and "`error: expected ‘)’ before ‘;’ token`". This points directly to the line where the condition `if(j==0 acc = 0;` is written.

3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Based on the error message and examining the line of code, it appears that the intended conditional reset of `acc` to 0 when `j==0` is incorrectly written. The condition is not properly closed with a parenthesis.

4. **Testing the Hypothesis**: To verify this hypothesis, I would correct the syntax by adding the missing parenthesis and semicolon as indicated by the error log. This should be `if(j==0) acc = 0;`.

5. **Reflection on Fix**: After modifying the line `if(j==0 acc = 0;` to `if(j==0) acc = 0;`, I would expect that this syntax error should be resolved as per the compiler's guidance. The code now correctly pairs the opening and closing parenthesis around the condition and follows it with a proper statement termination using a semicolon.

6. **Proceeding to the Next Error (if any)**: After fixing the syntax error, I would recompile the code to check if there are any further errors. The current compiler error log explicitly pointed out issues only related to this line, so fixing it should, in theory, resolve the compilation issues.

7. **Final Compilation**: Assuming no further errors are reported by the compiler after this fix, it would mean that the syntax error was the primary blocker for the compilation. I would then consider the code to be syntax-error-free and would proceed to runtime tests such as C-Simulation to ensure logical correctness.

Thus, by following the error messages provided in the log closely and making the necessary corrections, the syntax errors in the HLS code are resolved.
