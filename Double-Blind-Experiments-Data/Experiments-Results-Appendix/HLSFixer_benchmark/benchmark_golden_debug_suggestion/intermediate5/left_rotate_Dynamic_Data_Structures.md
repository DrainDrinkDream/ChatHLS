Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Error Identification**:
   - The error log indicates a runtime error during simulation with the message "free(): double free detected in tcache 2". This suggests an issue with memory management, particularly around dynamic memory allocation or deallocation.

2. **Analysis of the Error**:
   - The problematic code appears to involve dynamic memory allocation and deallocation: `new data_t(0)` and `delete reg_out_ptr;` within the function `left_rotate`. This is unusual for hardware design, especially for HLS, because it typically requires static, predictable memory usage patterns for synthesis.
   - Dynamic memory operations are generally not supported or recommended in HLS because they can lead to non-deterministic behavior and inefficiencies in hardware.

3. **Hypothesizing Causes**:
   - The use of a pointer `reg_out_ptr` and dynamic memory allocation for it likely causes the runtime error. Each time the function is called, it could potentially allocate new memory without properly freeing the previously allocated memory, or it could try to free already freed memory (double free).

4. **Proposed Fix**:
   - To resolve this, replace the dynamic memory usage with a static local variable. This change aligns with typical HLS practices, ensuring that all memory usage is predictable and efficiently mapped to hardware registers or RAM blocks.
   - Modify the line:
     ```cpp
     static data_t* reg_out_ptr = new data_t(0); 
     ```
     to:
     ```cpp
     static data_t reg_out = 0;
     ```
   - Adjust all dereferencing operations on `reg_out_ptr` to use the variable `reg_out` directly. This involves replacing instances like `*reg_out_ptr` with `reg_out`.
   - Remove the `delete reg_out_ptr;` line as it is no longer necessary and inappropriate in the context of static local variables.

5. **Testing and Verification**:
   - After making these changes, the function should be tested to ensure that it behaves as expected without any runtime errors. The absence of dynamic memory operations should eliminate the "double free" error seen in the simulation logs.

6. **Reflection and Further Steps**:
   - Reviewing the changes, if the fix aligns the functionâ€™s behavior with expected outcomes and passes HLS simulation and synthesis, the modifications are likely correct.
   - Further, this fix should make the function more suitable for hardware synthesis, ensuring that all operations can be directly mapped to hardware constructs without the overhead and unpredictability of dynamic memory management.

By focusing on static memory usage and eliminating dynamic allocations, the function is optimized for HLS, providing deterministic and efficient hardware behavior.
