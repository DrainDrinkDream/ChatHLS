**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Observation and Error Identification:**
   - Upon reviewing the Vitis HLS Compiler Error Log, the most notable errors that stand out are related to a string literal issue. The compiler points to a syntax error involving a missing terminating quote character and an expected primary expression before the closing brace.

2. **Error Analysis Based on Compiler Log:**
   - The error log specifically mentions: 
     ```text
     '../../../../left_rotate.cpp:40:27: error: missing terminating " character'
     ```
     This error indicates that the string defined in the line:
     ```cpp
     char* debug_message = "Rotation complete without errors;
     ```
     is not properly terminated with a quote. This is a clear syntax error as string literals in C++ need to be enclosed within double quotes.

   - The next error in the log states:
     ```text
     '../../../../left_rotate.cpp:41:1: error: expected primary-expression before ‘}’ token'
     ```
     This error is directly caused by the previous error because the compiler could not parse the code correctly due to the syntactical mistake in the string definition. It expected some form of expression or statement before encountering the '}' which marks the end of the function.

3. **Hypothesis and Fix Proposal:**
   - To fix these errors, the string must be correctly closed with a double quote. Correcting this should resolve both the syntax error and the misplaced '}' error since the rest of the function will then be parsed correctly by the compiler.

   - **Proposed Code Modification:**
     ```cpp
     char* debug_message = "Rotation complete without errors;";
     ```

4. **Reflection and Verification:**
   - After modifying the string declaration to be correctly terminated, reviewing the rest of the code for any similar issues or potential HLS-related issues (like unsupported operations or constructs) is necessary. Since no other errors are indicated in the error log, and the syntax now matches typical C++ conventions, it is reasonable to conclude that these changes should correct the compilation errors.

5. **Final Review:**
   - Ensure that the modified code aligns with C++ standard practices and HLS requirements. Assuming no further errors from the compiler, the fix should enable successful compilation and execution of the HLS simulation.

By following these steps, we've addressed the critical errors pointed out by the HLS compiler, and ensured the code is syntactically correct for further HLS processes.
