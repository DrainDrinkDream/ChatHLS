Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Error Identification**:
   The first thing to notice is the error identified by the compiler: `error: ‘assign’ was not declared in this scope`. This suggests that there is an incorrect or unrecognized keyword in the code. The compiler suggests an alternative, 'asin,' but that doesn't make sense in this context. 

2. **Analyzing the Error**:
   The line highlighted by the compiler is `assign out = reg_out;`. In standard C++, the correct way to assign a value to a variable is by using the assignment operator `=`, not the keyword `assign`. The use of `assign` suggests a misunderstanding or a typo since `assign` is not a keyword or function in C++.

3. **Propose a Fix**:
   To rectify this error, replace `assign out = reg_out;` with `out = reg_out;`. This change uses the correct syntax for assignment in C++.

4. **Verifying the Fix**:
   After making the change, it's important to test the code. Given the nature of the HLS environment, ensure that the simulation and synthesis steps do not produce further errors. The HLS tool should be able to recognize and correctly simulate or synthesize the `left_rotate` function now that the syntax error is corrected.

5. **Reflection and Next Steps**:
   The fix appears straightforward and directly addresses the compiler's complaint. If further issues arise, they would likely concern the logic within the function or other syntax errors not yet identified. Ensure that all types (`bool_t`, `amount_t`, `data_t`) are correctly defined and used. The function logic, based on the description of a left rotate operation, seems logically sound assuming the definitions of data types and their bit widths are appropriate for the operations performed (e.g., shifting operations assume an 8-bit width based on the rotation amounts). The next steps, upon encountering more issues, would involve checking these type definitions and ensuring that the shifting logic correctly matches the intended hardware implementation requirements.
