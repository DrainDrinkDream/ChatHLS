**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Error Identification**: The error log provided indicates two primary issues:
   - `../../../../left_rotate.cpp:35:13: error: case label not within a switch statement`
   - `../../../../left_rotate.cpp:37:17: error: break statement not within loop or switch`

   These errors suggest that there are misplaced or inappropriately used keywords related to a switch statement in the code. Specifically, the `default:` case and the `break` statement are outside the expected `switch` block.

2. **Analyzing the Code**: Upon inspecting the buggy code, I notice that the `default:` case is indeed outside the switch statement, which is the immediate cause of both the errors highlighted in the log. This is because the `default:` case is only valid inside a switch statement, and similarly, `break` is used incorrectly as it should only be used within loops or switch cases.

3. **Comparison and Reflection**: It is clear that for a well-structured switch statement in C++, all cases including the `default` case must be enclosed within the switch block. The misplaced `default:` keyword and `break` statement in the buggy code cause the compiler to throw errors as they are not recognized in their current context.

4. **Proposed Fix**:
   - Move the `default:` case and its associated `break` statement inside the curly braces `{}` of the switch block. This means placing the `default:` case just after the last case (`case 7`) inside the switch block.

5. **Code Modification**: To correct the code:
   - Adjust the placement of the `default:` case to be inside the switch statement.
   
   The correction would be as follows:
   ```cpp
   switch (amount) {
       case 0:
           break;
       case 1:
           reg_out = (reg_out << 1) | (reg_out >> 7);
           break;
       case 2:
           reg_out = (reg_out << 2) | (reg_out >> 6);
           break;
       case 3:
           reg_out = (reg_out << 3) | (reg_out >> 5);
           break;
       case 4:
           reg_out = (reg_out << 4) | (reg_out >> 4);
           break;
       case 5:
           reg_out = (reg_out << 5) | (reg_out >> 3);
           break;
       case 6:
           reg_out = (reg_out << 6) | (reg_out >> 2);
           break;
       case 7:
           reg_out = (reg_out << 7) | (reg_out >> 1);
           break;
       default:
           break;
   }
   ```

6. **Final Reflection**: This adjusted code should now compile correctly under the Vitis HLS toolchain, as the structural issue with the switch statement has been resolved. The changes ensure that all `case` and `default` statements are correctly scoped within the switch, adhering to C++ syntax rules.
