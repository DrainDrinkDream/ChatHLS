**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Examination and Error Identification**: 
   - The compilation error message points out a syntax issue: `'../../../../priority_encoder.cpp:13:21: error: expected ‘)’ before ‘{’ token`. This clearly indicates a problem at line 13 of the code where the condition for the third `else if` is written.
   - Upon inspecting line 13, it is evident that the condition is missing a closing parenthesis: `else if (in[2] {`. This syntax error would prevent the code from compiling, aligning with what's noted in the error log.

2. **Proposed Fix for Syntax Error**:
   - To resolve this error, add a closing parenthesis to complete the condition in the `else if` statement. Modify `else if (in[2] {` to `else if (in[2]) {`.

3. **Error Analysis and Hypothesis for Further Issues**:
   - The error log also mentions: `'../../../../priority_encoder.cpp:18:1: error: expected primary-expression before ‘}’ token`. This suggests that there might be an unexpected `}` or an issue with the structure of the code around line 18.
   - On inspecting the code structure after fixing the first issue, it seems that the braces are appropriately matched, which means the primary-expression error would likely be resolved by fixing the syntax error above.

4. **Testing and Verification**:
   - After adjusting the syntax by adding the missing parenthesis, the code structure looks correct without any unmatched braces or parentheses. This aligns the code more with typical C++ syntax rules, which should eliminate the primary-expression error as well.

5. **Reflection and Next Steps**:
   - With the above corrections, the syntax of the code should now be compatible with the requirements of the HLS compiler. The approach to debug was to first address the clear syntax errors highlighted by the compiler error log and then ensure the overall structure of the function did not introduce additional errors.
   - The next logical step would be to compile the code again to confirm if the changes have resolved the issues. If any further errors appear in the log, they should be addressed similarly by pinpointing the problematic code lines and adjusting them according to C++ syntax and logic.

This detailed analysis and rectification should resolve the compilation issues noted in the error log, allowing the HLS tool to proceed with simulation and synthesis of the given `priority_encoder` function.
