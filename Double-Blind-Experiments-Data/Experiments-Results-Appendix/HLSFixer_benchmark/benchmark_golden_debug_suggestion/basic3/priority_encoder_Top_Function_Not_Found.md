Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Error Identification**: 
   Reviewing the error log, it is evident that the primary issue is `"Top_Function_Not_Found"` along with multiple undefined references to `priority_encoder(ap_uint<3>, ap_uint<2>*)`. This suggests that the function intended as the top-level entry point for HLS synthesis is either missing, incorrectly named, or not visible.

2. **Analyzing Reasons**: 
   Given that the error specifically points to undefined references to a function called `priority_encoder`, it is probable that the function definition in the buggy code does not match the expected name or signature. The function in the buggy code is named `priority_encoder_wrong_name` which doesn't match the expected `priority_encoder`. This misnaming is likely causing the linkage errors during the compilation process, as the test environment and possibly other parts of the larger codebase expect a function named `priority_encoder`.

3. **Propose Fixes**: 
   To resolve this, rename the function from `priority_encoder_wrong_name` to `priority_encoder`. This change should align the function name with the expectations of the HLS environment and other parts of the code that call this function. Additionally, ensure that the function signature matches with what's expected in the error log, i.e., it should take `ap_uint<3>` for `input_t` and `ap_uint<2>*` for `output_t*`.

   The corrected function signature and name should be:
   ```cpp
   void priority_encoder(input_t in, output_t* pos) {
   ```

4. **Testing and Verification**: 
   After making the change, recompile the code using the Vitis HLS tool. Check the compilation logs to ensure that there are no undefined reference errors and that the function `priority_encoder` is now recognized correctly by the linker.

5. **Reflection**: 
   This debugging process highlights the importance of consistent naming conventions and adherence to expected signatures in function definitions, especially in a specialized environment like HLS where function names might be tied to specific configuration or test scripts. After renaming the function and ensuring it matches the expected signature, the code should compile without errors related to undefined references, resolving the `Top_Function_Not_Found` issue. Further testing in the HLS environment would be necessary to confirm the logical correctness beyond the syntactical correction.
