**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Review of Compiler Error Log**:
   - The error log indicates that the HLS compiler failed during source synthesis with specific errors related to dynamic memory allocation: use of `operator new` and `operator delete`.
   - The errors are:
     - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'priority_encoder(ap_uint<3>, ap_uint<2>*)': Undefined function operator new (priority_encoder.cpp:9:29)"
     - "ERROR: [HLS 214-194] in function 'priority_encoder(ap_uint<3>, ap_uint<2>*)': Undefined function operator delete (priority_encoder.cpp:23:5)"

2. **Analysis of Errors**:
   - High-Level Synthesis (HLS) often does not support dynamic memory allocation due to the deterministic nature of hardware and the need for predictable resource allocation during synthesis time.
   - The use of `new` and `delete` in the function suggests dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, which is generally not supported in HLS environments. This explains the error messages from the HLS compiler.

3. **Identification of Faulty Lines**:
   - The usage of `new` is seen on line 9: `output_t* dynamic_pos = new output_t;`
   - The usage of `delete` is seen on line 23: `delete dynamic_pos;`

4. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - The hypothesis is that replacing dynamic memory allocation with static memory management should resolve the synthesis errors.

5. **Proposed Fixes**:
   - Replace the dynamic allocation of `dynamic_pos` with a static variable. This avoids the need for `new` and `delete`.
   - Modify the code as follows:
     ```cpp
     void priority_encoder(input_t in, output_t* pos) {
         output_t dynamic_pos;  // use a static variable instead of a pointer

         if (in[0]) {
             dynamic_pos = 0;
         } else if (in[1]) {
             dynamic_pos = 1;
         } else if (in[2]) {
             dynamic_pos = 2;
         } else {
             dynamic_pos = 0;
         }

         *pos = dynamic_pos;  // directly assign the value to *pos, avoiding pointers where not needed
     }
     ```

6. **Reflection on the Fix**:
   - By eliminating dynamic memory allocation, the function should now be compatible with the limitations of HLS. The direct use of a static variable simplifies the code and adheres to the HLS requirements.

7. **Verification Strategy**:
   - If possible, re-run the HLS synthesis with the modified code to ensure that the errors related to dynamic memory allocation no longer appear.
   - Check that the logical functionality of the code remains intact by performing functional simulation (C-SIM).

This approach, based on a detailed error log analysis and understanding of HLS constraints, suggests that the main issue was dynamic memory allocation, and the proposed fix should make the code HLS-compatible while preserving its original logic.
