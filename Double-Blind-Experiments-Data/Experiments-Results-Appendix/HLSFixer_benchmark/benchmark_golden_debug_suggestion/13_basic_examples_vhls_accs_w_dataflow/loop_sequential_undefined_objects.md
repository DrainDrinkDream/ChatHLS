**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Observation from Error Log:**
   The compiler error log clearly points out an issue in the code:
   ```
   '../../../../loop_sequential.cpp:17:18: error: ‘C’ was not declared in this scope'
   ```
   This error indicates that the variable `C` is being used without being declared or defined anywhere in the scope of the function `loop_sequential`.

2. **Investigating the Code:**
   I look into the line of code mentioned in the error log:
   ```cpp
   Y_accum += C[i];
   ```
   Here `C[i]` is used to accumulate into `Y_accum`. Given the error that `C` is not declared, this line is definitely incorrect.

3. **Hypothesizing the Correct Variable:**
   In the context of the function `loop_sequential` which takes arrays `A` and `B` as input, it seems logical that operations related to array `A` are done in the first loop and similar operations should be done with array `B` in the second loop. The erroneous use of `C[i]` seems to be a typo or mix-up with the intended array `B[i]`.

4. **Proposed Fix:**
   To resolve the error, replace `C[i]` with `B[i]` in the SUM_Y loop:
   ```cpp
   Y_accum += B[i];
   ```

5. **Verification and Reflection:**
   By changing `C[i]` to `B[i]`, the code now correctly refers to the array `B` which is passed to the function and is in scope. This change should resolve the compilation error as `B` is defined within the function parameters. The logic of the function also remains consistent - `A` is used for `X` calculations and `B` for `Y`.

6. **Final Steps:**
   After making this change, recompile the code to ensure that no other errors exist and that the logic performs as expected. Testing the function with appropriate inputs for `A`, `B`, `xlimit`, and `ylimit` would also validate the correctness of the operation.

In summary, the error arises from using an undefined variable `C`, and the fix is to replace it with the correct variable `B` which is intended to be used in accumulating `Y_accum`. This change aligns with the function's design to perform operations separately on arrays `A` and `B` for outputs `X` and `Y` respectively.
