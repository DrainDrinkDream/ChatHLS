Chain of Thought (CoT):
```text
Step 1: Initial Analysis
- Upon reviewing the compiler error log, I noticed two primary errors related to the use of dynamic memory allocation (new[] and delete[]). These operations are not supported in the context of HLS, particularly within a DATAFLOW region. The errors mentioned are: "Undefined function operator new[]" and "Undefined function operator delete[]".

Step 2: Hypothesis Formation
- Based on the errors, I hypothesized that removing the dynamic memory allocation should resolve the compilation issues since HLS typically requires static, compile-time known allocations for efficient hardware mapping.

Step 3: Testing the Hypothesis
- I proposed removing the lines:
  ```cpp
  int* A1 = new int[N]; 
  ```
  and 
  ```cpp
  delete[] A1;
  ```
  These lines appear to be unnecessary for the functionality of the given code as they do not impact any other part of the code. They are not used anywhere except for their declaration and deletion.

Step 4: Reflection and Further Analysis
- After proposing the removal of dynamic memory allocation, I looked into the compiler warning about the canonical form of the DATAFLOW region. The warning was primarily due to the presence of these non-supported operations within the DATAFLOW pragma region. By removing these lines, this warning should also be resolved as the remaining code strictly involves loop constructs and simple arithmetic operations, which are typical and supported in HLS DATAFLOW regions.

Step 5: Final Review
- The final step was to ensure that no other part of the functionality was affected by this change. Given that the variables 'A1' were not used in any computations or affecting the loop constructs, their removal should not impact the functional behavior of the program. This was confirmed by observing that the original version of the code did not have these lines, and hence, their inclusion was not only unnecessary but also erroneous in the context of HLS synthesis.

Conclusion:
- The removal of the dynamic memory allocation (new[] and delete[]) in the DATAFLOW region resolves the compilation errors and adheres to HLS synthesis requirements. This change ensures that the program is both functional and compatible with HLS synthesis processes.
