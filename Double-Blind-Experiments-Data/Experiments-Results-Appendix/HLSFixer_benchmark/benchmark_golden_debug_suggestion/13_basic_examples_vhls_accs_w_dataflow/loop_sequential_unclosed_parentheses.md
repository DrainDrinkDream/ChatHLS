**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Identifying the Error:**
   The error log from the HLS compiler indicates a compilation error with the primary message being: "error: expected ‘}’ at end of input". This suggests a missing closing brace in the code. Additionally, the error log provides a specific line pointer indicating the issue near the end of the file after the last line of the function `loop_sequential`.

2. **Analyzing the Error:**
   Upon examining the code structure, I notice that both the `SUM_X` and `SUM_Y` loops are nested incorrectly. Specifically, the `SUM_Y` loop is nested inside the `SUM_X` loop, but the closing brace for the `SUM_X` loop is missing before the `SUM_Y` loop begins. This improper nesting likely led the compiler to expect another closing brace at the end of the file, which is not present.

3. **Proposing a Fix:**
   To resolve this error, I should:
   - Close the `SUM_X` loop properly before starting the `SUM_Y` loop. This involves adding a closing brace `}` after the line `X[i] = X_accum;` and before `SUM_Y:for (i=0;i<ylimit; i++) {`.
   - Ensure that both loops are at the same indentation level, indicating that they are not nested within each other.

4. **Modifying the Code:**
   The corrected segment of the code should look like this:
   ```cpp
   SUM_X:for (i=0;i<xlimit; i++) {
       X_accum += A[i];
       X[i] = X_accum;
   }  // Added closing brace here

   SUM_Y:for (i=0;i<ylimit; i++) {
       Y_accum += B[i];
       Y[i] = Y_accum;
   }
   ```

5. **Reflecting on the Findings:**
   The main issue stemmed from a simple syntactic mistake of a missing brace, which caused the compiler to misinterpret the end of the `loop_sequential` function. By adding the necessary brace to correctly structure the loops as sequential rather than nested, the syntax error should be resolved. This fix should allow the code to compile successfully in the HLS environment, as this aligns the structure with typical HLS expectations for loop constructs.

By following these steps, the code should now be free from the reported syntax error, and further testing in the HLS environment would verify the fix.
