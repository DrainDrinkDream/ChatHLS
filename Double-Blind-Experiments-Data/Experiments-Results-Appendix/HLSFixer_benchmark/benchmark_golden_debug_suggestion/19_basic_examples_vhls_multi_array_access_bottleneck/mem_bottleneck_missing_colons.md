Chain of Thought (CoT):
```text
To begin the debugging process, I start by examining the error log provided by the Vitis HLS compiler. The log mentions a specific syntax error: "error: expected ‘;’ before ‘return’". This error arises from line 9 in the buggy code, where it states:
    sum += mem[i] + mem[i-1] + mem[i-2]

Upon inspection, I notice that this line is missing a semicolon at the end. This is a typical syntax error in C/C++ where every statement must end with a semicolon. The lack of a semicolon causes the compiler to not recognize the end of the statement, hence it throws an error when it unexpectedly encounters the next keyword, which is `return`.

To fix this error, I will add a semicolon at the end of line 9:
    sum += mem[i] + mem[i-1] + mem[i-2];

After addressing the syntax error, I recheck the error log to ensure there are no additional warnings or errors. The log also mentioned "error: no return statement in function returning non-void", which suggests that there was confusion due to the syntax problem causing misinterpretation of code blocks. By fixing the semicolon, the `return sum;` line should now be correctly recognized as the return statement for the function, resolving this issue as well.

By fixing the syntax error, the function should now compile correctly under Vitis HLS, and the function's intended behavior to sum elements of the array with the previous two elements should proceed without further logical errors. The hypothesis here is that the primary issue was syntactical and not logical, as the summing operation and loop construct are typical and correctly implemented for HLS requirements, assuming the sum does not cause overflow or other runtime errors.

Reflecting on this debugging process, the error was straightforward and involved a common mistake that can be easily overlooked. Ensuring all statements are properly terminated with semicolons is a fundamental practice in C/C++ programming. Future checks can include automated linting tools to catch such simple issues before compilation in an HLS context.
