**Chain of Thought (CoT):**

1. **Initial Analysis of Compiler Error Log**:
   - The first error indicated is `expected primary-expression before '/' token`. This error points directly to the line with `/ illegal`. It suggests that the compiler was not expecting a slash (`/`) at this position, indicating a syntax issue.
   - The second error `‘illegal’ was not declared in this scope` suggests that after the compiler parsed the slash, it treated the subsequent word `illegal` as a variable or a function which it couldn't recognize in the scope.
   - The third error `expected ';' before ')' token` at the `for` loop suggests a syntax issue in the loop declaration, specifically before the loop's closing parenthesis.

2. **Hypothesis on Errors Based on Error Log**:
   - The presence of `/ illegal` seems to be an incorrectly formatted comment. In C++, comments should start with `//` for single-line comments. The use of a single slash might have confused the compiler, leading to further parsing errors.
   - The error in the `for` loop likely arose because the misinterpreted comment above caused parsing issues, disrupting the normal interpretation of the following lines.

3. **Proposed Fixes**:
   - Change the `/ illegal` to `// illegal` to correctly format it as a comment. This should resolve the parsing issues with the comment and prevent the compiler from misinterpreting subsequent code.
   - After correcting the comment, recheck the syntax around the loop to ensure no further syntactic issues remain.

4. **Validation and Reflection**:
   - Applying the correction of the comment syntax should clear the first two errors related to unexpected tokens and undeclared identifiers since these stemmed from the incorrect comment syntax.
   - Fixing the comment will likely resolve the third error automatically as the parsing will not be disrupted, and the compiler will recognize the syntax of the `for` loop correctly.

5. **Plan for Next Steps**:
   - Implement the fix by changing `/ illegal` to `// illegal`.
   - Re-compile the code to ensure that all syntax errors are cleared.
   - If the syntax errors are resolved, proceed to test the functionality of the code to make sure the logic behaves as expected.
   - If any further errors or unexpected behaviors are observed in the testing phase, analyze them in the context of this corrected code structure.

By following this detailed reasoning and step-by-step approach, the code errors identified in the HLS compiler error log can be systematically addressed and resolved.
