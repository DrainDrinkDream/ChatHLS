Chain of Thought (CoT):

1. **Initial Analysis of Compiler Error Log**:
   The compiler error log indicates a compilation error with the message `'j' was not declared in this scope` pointing to the line `sum += mem[i] + mem[j-1] + mem[i-2];`. This error suggests that the variable `j` is being used without being declared or initialized.

2. **Identification of the Problematic Line in the Buggy Code**:
   The problematic line in the buggy code is:
   ```cpp
   sum += mem[i] + mem[j-1] + mem[i-2];
   ```
   This line attempts to use the variable `j`, which hasn't been declared anywhere in the provided function. This directly correlates with the compiler error stating that `j` was not declared.

3. **Hypothesis Formation from Error Analysis**:
   Given that `j` is not declared and its intended value is not clear from the context, a common mistake in array processing is to incorrectly reference indices. Since the loop variable is `i` and operates from `i=2` to `i<N`, it's reasonable to consider that the intended operation should involve only `i` and its derivatives (like `i-1`, `i-2`).

4. **Proposed Fix Based on Hypothesis**:
   To fix the error, replace `mem[j-1]` with `mem[i-1]`. This adjustment is based on the typical pattern of accessing consecutive elements in an array within a loop, especially when considering the indices start from `i=2`, making `mem[i-1]` and `mem[i-2]` valid accesses:
   ```cpp
   sum += mem[i] + mem[i-1] + mem[i-2];
   ```
   This change ensures that all the indices are correctly derived from the loop variable `i` and are valid throughout the loop's execution.

5. **Validation and Reflection**:
   After adjusting the code, the line aligns well with common practices of accessing array elements in a sequential and safe manner within a loop. This change should resolve the compilation error as it addresses the undeclared variable issue and maintains logical access to the array elements.

By making this amendment, the code should compile successfully in the HLS environment, and the functionality intended by iterating through the array and summing specific elements is preserved and corrected. This step-by-step analysis based on the compiler error and the structure of the code itself leads to a logical correction.
